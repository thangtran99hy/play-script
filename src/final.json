The test might be multiple-choice. The test might be an essay. The test might be fill-in-the-blank. Remember to get good rest. Also, eat a healthy breakfast. Nothing with too much sugar. Eat something like a fruit salad. Don't eat pancakes with syrup. Good luck!",

Terrorists attack these big cities though, because they know that there will be a lot of people. The truth is, we should not stop people from studying abroad. These terrorist attacks can happen anytime. We can't live life in fear. We must do the things we love.\nPeople are also scared to travel in general, because of plane accidents. Terrorists often bring explosives on planes. Some people are also scared of dying on a plane. All the passengers in Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 are missing. We still don't know what happened to them. Not too long after, all the passengers in Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 died. It was a very tragic event.\nIt is scary that our lives can end so quickly and suddenly. We need to live life to the fullest. We need to love the people around us and be thankful for every day that we live. There are always news stories about people dying before they should. It's not the best thing to hear about, but it makes us more aware of our own lives.",

An example of procrastination would be starting a project one day before it is due. Procrastinating is bad, because it makes a person stressed out. It is also bad, because the end product is usually not very good.\nSince studying is not very fun, students play video games, hanging out with friends, and eating out before studying. They end up studying the night before the test and do not get much sleep. This is bad, because eight hours of sleep or more is needed to do well. Students who procrastinate end up doing badly on tests. Teachers always encourage students to start early and do a little bit of studying every day.\nProcrastination does not just happen in school, it happens everywhere. People put off going to the doctor, applying for jobs, and more. Some people say that procrastination is just human nature. However, some people say that they do well when they procrastinate. They say that stress makes them work faster.",

In some countries, power is passed on to relatives, and the people don't get any say in who the leader of the country should be. However, a lot of people in the United States, especially young people, do not vote.\nThere are many reasons why people don't vote. Firstly, they don't believe their vote matters. The truth is, everyone's vote matters! Secondly, they don't think that anything will change if they vote. Although, it's hard to see big changes right away, the presidential candidate you vote for affects many policies. Thirdly, people are lazy to go out of their house to vote. This is the worst excuse.\nPeople need to realize that voting is a privilege. Imagine if we couldn't vote. We would feel out of the loop. We would feel that our opinion doesn't matter. If you don't vote for a candidate, then you have no right to complain about the president who will be elected.",

Before she arrived at the corner, she could smell the fried chicken. The restaurant was open seven days a week, and the odor of fried chicken was in the neighborhood daily. She was a vegetarian. She used to eat meat and fish. But that was before she found a dead cat in her dumpster one day. Of course, she had smelled the dead cat before she opened the dumpster lid. Everyone knows the smell of dead flesh. She knew that something in the dumpster was dead, but she didn't know what. Just in case it was a human (some people dump their babies into dumpsters), she opened the lid. She saw the cat. Flies covered most of it. They were enjoying their meal. She loved cats. She had two of her own. A week later at a restaurant, she ordered a hamburger. She took one bite out of it, and almost gagged. She spit it out. All she could think about was the smell of that dead cat. That was the day she became a vegetarian.",

The breakfast was from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. They told everyone to bring their appetites, not their cash. The delicious meal  included pancakes, eggs, bacon, and sausages. People got up at the crack of dawn to beat the rush. Ben and Mary woke up at 5 a.m. Monday. They got dressed and drove to Denny's. They got in line at 5:20. \"Oh, my,\" said Mary. \"There's a hundred people in front of us. Look how long this line is already. We should have come here at 4:20.\" The line moved slowly forward. Ben started talking to the man behind them. His name was Brad. His name was Brad. Brad had brought his wife, their five kids, and his brother's four kids. \"What a deal, huh? I only wish we had more kids to bring,\" Brad said. \"They say there's no such thing as a free lunch. But today Denny's is showing America that there is such a thing as a free breakfast.\"",

They were the regular price, 79 cents a pound. He bought three pounds of bananas. When he saw the carrots, he remembered that he needed carrots, too. He put a two-pound bag of carrots into his cart. They were only $1.29. He walked to the dairy section and saw that a gallon of milk was $4. He put one into his cart and walked back to the front of the store.

Buying the right car to fit a particular need is not as easy as it seems. The first thing a new car buyer should do is to figure out how much he or she can buy. Car prices range from a couple of thousand dollars for a used vehicle to over ten or twenty thousand for a new one.\nOnce a buyer determines the price of a car that he or she can afford, it is time to start shopping. One way to shop for a car is to use the Internet. There are many websites that deal exclusively in finding the right car for any person. Try cars.com, or autotrader.com for starters. Additionally, most major car dealerships have their own online websites, where prospective buyers can sit in the comfort of their own home and search for cars. All of these websites let buyers narrow their search using filters such as minimum and maximum prices, make, model, year, color, and new or used. These are very powerful tools that are available to consumers with just a click of the mouse. Another way to find a car is the old-fashioned way, that is, to visit a car dealership and talk to a sales person.\nOnce a car is purchased, it must be registered with the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). For most new car sales through dealerships, the registration is taken care of for the consumer. The registration paperwork and fees are sent directly to the DMV. When a used car is purchased through a private owner, the registration has to be done by the buyer. It is a simple process. Just go to the DMV with the paperwork, pay the fee and they'll do the rest.",

        "content": "Unlike many countries in the world, the United States traffic flows on the right-hand side of the road. This may cause some confusion for persons who come from a country that drives on the left. The tradition of driving on the right goes back to before the advent of the automobile. The first law enacted to require people to drive on the right was passed in the city of Philadelphia in 1792. Cities throughout the country soon followed, and the tradition became common.\nIn addition to driving on the right, most Americans use various lights installed into vehicles to signal other drivers of their intentions. The most used lights on a car are the headlights, high beams, turn signals, emergency flashers, and backup lights. Headlights and high beams are used in night driving. It is illegal to drive with high beams constantly on because they can blind drivers driving in the opposite direction, but headlights are required at all times after dark. Turn signals let other drivers know you are about to make a turn to either the right or the left. These signals should be used every time a vehicle is about to make a turn.\nEmergency flashers are continuously blinking yellow lights that drivers use when their vehicle is disabled, or they are experiencing an emergency. Backup lights are white lights that come on whenever the car's transmission is put into the reverse mode. These lights help the driver see what's behind them when backing up. All of these signal lights are important for the safe operation of a motor vehicle. By using these tools properly, a driver can make driving for all people a safe and enjoyable experience.",

It is normal to run several errands to multiple locations during any given day and most people do this in their own private vehicle. Individuals who have infant children must use child safety seats wherever they go with their kids. It is not only a good idea, but also required by law.\nIn California, children under 2 years of age must ride in a rear-facing car seat in the back seat unless that child weighs more that 40 pounds, or is more than 40 inches tall. If a child exceeds this height and weight requirement, he or she must then be secured in a car seat, or booster seat until the age of 8. Again, these seats must be placed in the back seat of a car. It isn't until a child is 8 years old, or has reached 4'9\" in height that he or she can ride using only an adult seatbelt. It is mandatory that passengers over the age of 16 must wear adult seat belts.\nIt is further recommended that a child should be kept in a car seat or booster seat for as long as possible. Even though it may sound like a good idea to move a child from a smaller car seat to a larger one, the California Highway Patrol advises to keep your child in a car seat for as long as the manufacturer recommends it. In other words, if a child seat manufacturer places a limit on how large a child can be to use a particular seat, then parents should keep their children in those seats until they reach that limit.

        "content": "One of the worst decisions anyone can make is to drive a car after having too many alcoholic drinks. Alcohol will affect drivers in a way they may not even realize. Alcohol is a depressant that slows down a person's reactions. It also affects different people in different ways. Some people  can have a beer or two, or maybe a couple of cocktails without being negatively affected, while others will be severely impaired with the same amount. For those who have a lower threshold for alcoholic drinks, even one or two drinks can mean trouble when driving an automobile.\nNot only is drinking and driving not a good idea, it is against the law. In the United States, Driving Under the Influence (DUI) of drugs or alcohol is a very serious offense. If a person is caught by the police on a DUI charge, it will mean trouble for that person. Being convicted of DUI can mean the loss of the person's driver's license, a large fine, and worst of all, it may mean jail time.\nDrinking and driving could also be dangerous. If a person drives after having a few too many drinks, his or her driving skills will not be as good as they should be. Drivers must have control at all times. Remember, a driver is operating a vehicle that weighs about 2,000 pounds, which could reach speeds of up to 100 miles per hour. Driving a car is a great responsibility. Drunk drivers can cause accidents, injuries, and even deaths. So the next time you are going out for a good time, please consider using a ride-sharing service, or a taxi. Enjoy yourself.

        "content": "Most large cities in the United States have their own police departments, and part of these departments' duties is traffic control. Whenever a person is driving through any city, it is a good idea to obey all the traffic laws. Some of the basic laws, like stopping at red lights, speeding, and making U-turns, are similar in most cities, but that is not always the case. Sometimes what is legal in one city might be illegal in another. It is wise to check the traffic laws in cities where drivers work and live.\nWhenever drivers are stopped or \"pulled over\" by a policeman, it is important to move the vehicle into the nearest, safe area near a curb. Drivers will know they are being pulled over by the flashing red and blue lights atop of the police car. This is a signal that the police want you to stop. The reasons police pull cars over are many. It could be that the driver was going too fast, or that he or she failed to stop at a traffic light or stop sign. It could also be because one of the car's lights is out, or the vehicle registration is expired. These are just some of the reasons police pull drivers over.\nThere are certain things drivers need to do whenever they are faced with this situation. The first thing a driver should do is to comply with any instructions the police officer may be giving them over the speaker. If no instructions are given, pull to the nearest safe spot and wait in the driver's seat until the officer comes to the door. Always be polite and give the officer your driver's license, proof of insurance, and current registration. Remember, you should always be respectful.",

        "content": "Driving in California, and in the rest of the United States, is a privilege. All states have a system in place to test a potential driver's knowledge and skill behind the wheel before issuing a driver's license. Some traffic laws can be tricky, but if drivers are well informed about the driving laws in the state, they can avoid getting ticketed.\nSome of the basic laws are easy to understand. Traffic signals, stop and yield signs, school zones, and crosswalks are all easily visible and are not complicated. For example, traffic signals use three colors, red, amber (yellow), and green. Red means to stop and green to go. Amber is used to notify drivers that the green light they are approaching is about to change to red. Whenever a driver sees an amber light in the distance, he or she should begin slowing down in anticipation of the red stop light. Arrows are also used to indicate direction. The same three colors are used with arrows, so there can be no confusion as to what to do when you see a directional signal.\nStop and yield signs  are easy to follow, but school zones and crosswalks can be confusing. School zones generally mean to slow down, but this is only during school hours. The rest of the time, there are no additional speeding restrictions in a school zone. Crosswalks are important only when there are people using them, or about to use them. Drivers must slow down when a person is approaching a crosswalk.\nThe single most important thing to watch while driving is your speed. Going faster than the posted speed limit will almost always get you a ticket if you are seen by the police. So slow down, and pay attention to traffic signs and signals to avoid a ticket and fine.",

A person who drives a car has the freedom to go wherever he or she wants, for the most part. However, driving a car comes with responsibilities. One of the primary responsibilities is that a driver must have auto insurance. Car insurance, like most other insurances, is designed to protect the buyer, in this case, the car owner from suffering great expenses in an emergency situations. No matter how good a driver you may be, there are many other drivers on the road, and many of them may not be as good a driver as you are. It is important to recognize this since you are sharing the road with them.\nThere are two basic types of car insurance, liability and collision. The state of California requires that all drivers carry liability insurance. Collision insurance is optional unless the driver has borrowed money to buy the car from a financial institution. In that case, the bank, or credit union, will require the driver to purchase collision insurance.\nLiability insurance is a part of the general insurance system of risk financing to protect the insured person from the risks of liabilities from lawsuits and similar claims. It protects the policy holder in the event he or she is sued for claims that come within the coverage of the insurance policy. For the most part, liability insurance will cover a person from financial damages caused by the insured. So if you cause an accident, liability insurance will protect you. It will cover property damage, and bodily harm damage up to the amount of insurance purchased, so think carefully about any financial caps you set on your insurance. The best thing to do, as always, is to shop around.",

        "content": "Most people have a regular work or school schedule to adhere to. Many jobs and classes are conducted during the early morning to mid-afternoon hours, but of course there are exceptions. In California, there are many ways to get to work and school during these rush hours. This includes public transportation such as commuter trains and buses. Additionally, many people use their own transportation to get to and from where they are going. This is where car-pooling and HOV (High-Occupancy Vehicles) lanes come in handy.\nCarpooling is where a group of people join together to share a ride to work or school. Some large companies encourage their employees to carpool, and actually help match people with each other. It is a simple concept. Two, or more people who live close to each other and work in the same place can make arrangements to meet at specific times and in specific locations to share rides. The more people who join a carpool, the better the benefits. Having four people in your group is better than two because the more people who contribute to expenses, the less each individual pays. Expenses usually include gas and toll fares. Additionally, each person takes turns using his or her car which saves wear on their vehicles.\nAnother benefit that comes from carpooling is that you get to use the HOV Lanes on freeways. These lanes are reserved for carpools meaning not everyone can use them. They are generally free of traffic congestion, and can make your commute to work or school a quick and easy trip. So if you are interested in saving a little money on gas, or not using your car every day, look to your peers to start a carpool. All it takes is one other person to start a carpool, and the benefits may prove to be a pleasant experience.",

These travel methods serve well not only Americans whenever they go on vacation or on a business trip to another city, but also those who work, or attend school in the same city they live in. In California, which is the most populous state in the country and the third largest in area, getting around is easy. There are commuter trains to take people quickly and efficiently to and from work, school, or when on recreation. Additionally, nearly every city has bus service that commuters can use to reach other neighborhoods. Southern California boasts the largest car culture in the country. Nearly everyone in the region owns a car that they use on a daily basis to get to work, school, or elsewhere.\nIn recent years there has been great importance placed on expanding the existing commuter train system in California. In Southern California, Metro has added a number of new commuter train lines that help residents get from place to place. The same situation exists in other large cities and regions throughout the state. California has also decided to build a high-speed rail line linking Southern California with Northern California. This \"Bullet Train\" is currently under construction and should be in place in the near future. Once it is built it will give travelers who would normally fly an option to take the train instead. This is good news to those who are afraid of flying, or do not have time to take a bus.\nOther ways of getting around in the country have appeared in recent years. Car sharing services such as Uber and Lyft have come onto the scene. These services are similar to taking a traditional Taxi, and are very popular. All these services will pick you up and take you to your destination for a fee.",

Putting a little money away every month can help you build a savings that can, in time, open new financial doors for you. Money saved can be very useful for a number of different reasons. One of the biggest reasons to have a savings account is that you will have money to draw from if you, or someone you love, have an emergency. It gives you a good feeling to know that you can help if the time ever comes.\nChecking accounts allow you to use your money in different ways. They are tied to a debit card that a person can use just about anywhere. Debit cards are direct withdrawals  from your checking account. You can also write a check in any amount that is covered by your checking account balance. Most places of business, schools and government agencies accept checks. The United States Government insures most savings and checking accounts opened in banks, so your money is safer in a bank than it is put at home.\nYou want to open the right account for you. Financial institutions will help you save your money and grow your wealth in different ways. Some pay more interest than others. Others give the saver rewards that can be redeemed in several different ways. Some banks have higher fees than others. In any event, the best way to find a bank is by doing a little research before you commit to a bank.",

Living on your own, or sharing a place with someone else, comes with financial responsibilities though. To be able to pay your share of rent and living expenses, it is a good idea to create a budget. A budget is the practice of gathering your income and expenses to help you keep track of your spending so that you won't fall short at the end of the month.\nAlong with your monthly rent are food, clothing, utilities, transportation, phones, and entertainment. There may be other expenses you have to pay monthly, but those depend on the individual's lifestyle. Only you can determine what expenses have the most priority in your life. Managing money can be a tricky thing. There often are unexpected expenses that come up from time to time, so it is a good idea to try to save a portion of your monthly income. Having some savings can be very helpful when an unexpected bill comes your way.\nAccounting for all your monthly expenses can also help you identify whether or not you are living within your budget. If you find that you have more expenses than income, a budget will help you see where you can cut corners. If, for instance, you are paying too much for your cell phone, you may want to get a cheaper plan. If you are paying too much rent, then it might be wise to move to a more affordable place, or take in a roommate. Whatever financial issue you may be having, a budget will help you figure it out.",

        "content": "The United States has a well-developed economic structure. Banks are in the business of lending money, holding savings, helping buy homes, and providing credit to those who are qualified. A credit card can be a useful tool if used wisely. It gives people a sense of freedom by giving them the power to purchase products without cash. Basically, credit card use is a bank loan that the user promises to pay back with interest. Credit card transactions are common in the United States.\nTo acquire a credit card, you can visit a bank, or go online to find banks offering cards. Banks base their interest rate on a person's credit history and assets. The better your credit history, the better position you will be in to get the best credit card interest rate. Interest rates vary greatly. Some can be as high as 20 to 25 percent, while others are well under 10 percent.\nWhen a person first applies for a credit card with little or no credit history, the interest rate will not be as low as it is for a person who has a well-established credit history. However, don't become discouraged. Everyone has to start somewhere. A new credit card holder will probably be limited to a $500 credit line. This is a figure that many banks use for new credit card customers. This limit is in place until the cardholder shows that he or she is a responsible person by making the monthly payments on time. If the credit card payment is due on the 25th day of each month, it will be a good idea to pay it a day or two before that date. With that done, the credit line will increase giving the user more freedom to use his or her card.",

Writing checks was the only way, other than paying cash, to pay bills in the past, but with the advent of the Internet and online banking, it is used sparingly today. Still, most lenders will accept written checks as payment for most bills.\nMost companies pay their employees electronically today, but some still issue checks. Paychecks are issued either every week or every other week. In order for an employee to cash the check, he or she will need proper identification. Accepted IDs would be a state driver's license, or a state-issued identification card. People can go to any Department of Motor Vehicles in any state to acquire an ID. Once a person has an ID, he or she can go to a bank, credit union, or check-cashing business to cash their check. It is a simple process. The best thing to do is to open a checking or savings account at a bank where you plan to cash your checks. This way you can avoid charges from check-cashing businesses for their services.\nWriting a check is easy, too. Once you have a checking account, and enough funds to cover your checks, you can use your checks at many retail outlets. Checks can also be used to pay back personal loans to friends or family. Remember, writing good checks that will not give the recipients trouble cashing can be to your advantage. Your reputation and credit rating can be established or damaged depending on how good your checks are. One of the worst things you can do is to write checks when you do not have the funds to cover them. Be responsible, not to write bad checks.",

The most basic way this can be done is to put your savings into a high-yield account that pays the best interest. Shopping around at different financial institutions would be a good idea so that you get the best interest for the amount of money you have to invest. Additionally, new technology, in the form of investment applications, have made it easier, and more convenient to begin building your finances.\nWith new technology, all you need to start is an investment app, and a smartphone. These apps can help you get started investing, track and project your investments, and establish a goal. The more traditional ways to save are simple. Most investors suggest you first have six-months' worth of savings in your account before you begin investing. The best way to start saving is to put away a portion of your pay. If, for instance, you save just $10 per week, at the end of the year you will have saved  more than $500. Another smart investment option is to enroll in your company's retirement plan. Many companies will match your investment dollars with their own. This can be a powerful way to invest in the future and have a nice retirement income when the time comes.\nMutual funds are also attractive to new investors.

These reports are like a running log, or diary, or your credit transactions. A good credit report can be a great asset to an individual just as a poor report can make it difficult for people to better their lives. There are three major credit report agencies in the U.S., Transunion, Equifax, and Experian. All work in the same way. The agencies take your credit history, accounts, and trends to establish your personal credit rating. It is a complicated process, but if you apply some common-sense financial practices, you can raise your rating as time goes by.\nThe most basic aspect of any credit rating is how individuals pay their bills. Too many missed payments or late payments will lower your score, so it is important to always make your payments on time. Another consideration is having too many credit card accounts. Once you have a good credit rating, you will begin getting offers from banks that want your business. The general rule is to have no more than a couple of credit cards. If you are going to have multiple accounts, it is best to have one Visa and one MasterCard, although some people  prefer American Express cards. Another thing to watch for is your balances.\nCredit card balances are important because they show the credit bureaus how you manage your accounts. It is best to use no more than 60 percent of your credit card limit. So, if you have a $1,000 credit limit, try to keep your balance around $600. If you use too much of your balance, it tells the bureaus that you are stretched for money. Be smart with your accounts, and a good credit rating will follow.",

The crime happens when someone uses information about you for his or her financial gain without your permission. Whenever a person has their identity stolen, the criminal can break into their bank accounts, use their active credit cards to purchase goods and services, and acquire new credit cards. Once a person has his or her identity stolen, it can take years to recover from the theft. However, there are some steps you can take that will help protect your identity and your assets.\nOne of the most important things to do is to protect your Social Security Number (SSN). This number is what the government, employers, and financial institutions use to track your financial life. The SSN should be kept in a safe place, and the number should be used carefully. Do not give it out to anyone you don't trust. Other things to consider are your billing statements, credit reports, receipts, and bank statements. Look for unauthorized charges on your credit cards, and for new credit information on your credit reports. The sooner you detect any unusual financial activity, the easier it will be to repair the damage.\nIdentity theft can affect more than your credit scores or bank accounts though. Some of the less apparent effects can be losing employment opportunities since many employers use credit information as a screening tool for new hires. With your identity information, people can compromise your income tax returns. It also can prevent victims from opening new credit accounts, or making a major purchase. The identity theft issues must be cleaned up in order to move forward with any large purchases and get the best interest rates.

The number can also be used to report other emergencies such as fires, automobile accidents, personal injuries, or thefts.\nThe 911 emergency number is a very useful tool that was first put into use in the late 1960s, but it wasn't until the early 1980s that most of the country had the system in place. Today, 96 percent of the United States has a 911 call system in place. Additionally, 911 can be called from just about every phone in the country. A person can use  their personal cell phone, a public pay phone, a home phone, or business work phone to make the call. 911 is an important number to remember.\nAn example of when a person can call 911 is when he or she witnesses an auto accident. If a person is driving through the streets or freeways and witnesses an accident, it would be smart to call 911 to report the accident. Many things can happen when there is an auto accident, and some may not be apparent. The drivers and passengers could be injured and in need of medical attention.

It is important to know a few things  about ER services before you go to one when you are in need of immediate medical attention.\nThe first thing you should do is to locate the nearest ER in the neighborhood you live in since that is where you spend the majority of your time. It would also be a good idea  to know where the ERs are near your place of work or school. ERs are for emergency treatment only. If you are in an auto accident, or have fallen and feel confused, it may be good to get to an ER to get checked out. Other symptoms that may require ER services are, shortness of breath, severe pain, pressure on the chest, or changes in your vision. In cases of severe trauma, emergency medical personnel such as paramedics will be sent to your location for assessment and treatment. If this occurs and it is determined that you need further emergency treatment, the paramedics, or an ambulance will transport you to the nearest center.\nIt is also important to know that ERs are expensive, so if you don't have medical insurance, a visit to an ER can be expensive. This is not to say that you must have insurance to receive emergency medical treatment though. ERs cannot refuse treatment to any person regardless of their ability to pay for the service. Be prepared to answer questions that medical personnel will ask. Sometimes these questions  may seem too personal, but it is necessary  to know as much about you before medical providers can treat you properly.",

An urgent care center provides medical services to those that are in need of medical care that is not life-threatening. Life-threatening injuries or illnesses should always be treated at an ER. For example, if you are in an auto accident and suffer great injuries, or if you think you are having a heart attack, it is best to go directly to an emergency room, not an urgent care facility. Many times emergency medical personnel responding to your call will take you to an ER automatically.\nSome of the typical ailments that may be considered treatable by an urgent care facility include sprained ankles, muscle strains, breathing difficulties, fever or flu, severe sore throat, and skin irritations. Most of the time, these conditions do not require a visit to the ER and can be treated at an urgent care center. However, if a person goes to an urgent care facility and it is determined that his or her condition requires an ER visit, the professionals at these facilities will arrange transportation to an ER. Some conditions are not treatable at urgent care centers.\nAnother difference between the two is that emergency rooms are open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, whereas urgent care facilities are open and available during the center's regular working hours. Most major medical facilities offer urgent care treatment and services. If you visit a particular medical center regularly, it would be a good idea to check to see if it provides urgent care to its patrons.",

Many personal questions will be included in this questionnaire, but keep in mind that the reason for this is done with your health care in mind. This sheet will be used to assess your health condition before you undergo a physical examination. It is important to note that you should be as truthful about your health as you can be, even if that truth may be embarrassing. By being completely honest with your doctor, he or she will have a better idea of how to proceed with your treatment if treatment is necessary.\nOne of the questions that may be listed is about your medical history. In order to move forward with a treatment plan, it is important for a doctor to know of any illnesses you have dealt with in the past. If, for instance, there is a history of cancer or heart disease in your family, this information could be very valuable to your doctor. Other questions may include drinking and smoking habits, allergies, and the medications  you are currently taking.

There are, however, some basic steps to take.\nThe first thing you should do is to take a look at your surroundings to see if it is safe  to approach the injured person. If the person is alert, ask a few basic questions that will help you determine what to do next. Some questions you can ask are: How were you injured? Do you have any pain? If so, where? What did you eat last? Is there anything about your medical history that can help? These simple questions can help you assess the person's condition before you get started.\nThe next thing a first aid administrator should do is ask for permission from the injured person to perform first aid. It would also be wise to tell them exactly what you are going to do before you do it. If the person is unconscious, try to proceed to the best of your ability. A first aid kit would help and if there is anyone else around you, it would be good to ask for help. Call 911 and try to calm the person down by reassuring him or her that help is on the way.

When a person is choking, his or her airway is obstructed and the person cannot breathe. Let's say you are at a restaurant when your guest, or maybe even a complete stranger, begins to gasp for air and clutches at his or her neck. This is a clear sign that something is very wrong, but what do you do? Your actions in the next few minutes can mean the life or death of a person right in front of you.\nChoking is the mechanical obstruction of the flow of air from the environment into the lungs. Choking prevents breathing, and can be partial or complete, with partial choking allowing some, although inadequate, flow of air into the lungs. Prolonged or complete choking results in asphyxia which leads to anoxia and is potentially fatal. Oxygen stored in the blood and lungs can keep a person alive for several minutes after breathing stops, so you can see how important it is for you to act, and to act quickly.\nIf a person can still breathe and talk, coughing often does the trick. But when someone is truly choking, it means the food or object is completely blocking the airway and air cannot flow into and out of the lungs. When the person cannot cough the object out and cannot breathe, talk, or even make noise, it means choking is severe. You should begin by using the Heimlich maneuver, but it is important that you are trained in administering this treatment. If you are not trained in the Heimlich maneuver, find someone who is, or call the 911 emergency number immediately.",

Some drivers may not be as cautious as you,  and that is why you must always be alert. Even the best drivers get into accidents, and sometimes they can be at fault, too. No one is perfect, and mistakes can happen.\nOnce an accident has happened, it is important to file a claim with your insurance company as soon as possible. Insurance claims are investigated by the insurance company, which means the circumstances surrounding the accident are carefully examined. Usually, when an accident occurs, the local police department will arrive at the scene and write a report. This report is a very important document that your insurance company is sure to request after you place a claim. The report will describe in detail what the police officer has determined has happened to cause the accident. Who caused the accident is very important to insurance companies because whoever is at fault will be the one who pays for the damages caused by the accident.\nSo if someone drives through a stop sign and hits you, the accident is that person's fault and his or her insurance must pay for your damages. If it is you who goes through the stop sign, then it is your fault, and your insurance must pay. If the accident is not your fault, a police report will support your claim that the accident is not your fault.

Income tax is a tax placed on working individuals on the money they earned the previous year. Both the state and federal governments impose this tax, and in some cases, city and county also. For most individuals, the employer deducts your federal, and state taxes from each pay period. The amount they take from workers is based on a W-4 form that is filled out as part of the hiring process. Each company is required by law to hold income tax from their employees, with few exceptions. In order to gain legal employment in the U.S., a person must have a Social Security Number (SSN). This is the number individuals use to file their taxes each year.\nThe most common federal tax form used by individuals is the form 1040, followed by the 1040EZ. These federal tax forms are similar, but the form 1040 is more complex. The 1040EZ is a form that many new employees use especially if they do not earn much money. The rate that a person is taxed is partially based on the number of dependents that person has. For instance, if an individual has a wife and three children, the husband can claim five dependents (including himself). This person will be taxed at a lower rate than a person who has only one, or two dependents. When filling out the employer's W-4 form, individuals must be honest about the number of dependents they claim.\nThe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is the agency that collects income taxes for the federal government, and in California, it is the State Tax Franchise Board.

        "content": "In the United States of America, a complex educational system exists. It is designed to provide academic skills to its residents. People living in the U.S. can begin their education as early as the age of three, and continue their academic careers well into adulthood. How long someone goes to school varies greatly from individual to individual. It all depends on what individuals want from the educational system and life in general. Some people are satisfied with achieving a high school diploma, while others strive for higher education.\nBy the time children reach the age of three, parents will often enroll them into preschool.  Some schools offer classes for children who are as young as two, but three is usually the youngest age children begin their education. After preschool comes kindergarten to 6th grade in the public school system. The 6th grade is the last year of elementary school. Once a child has completed elementary school, he or she will be enrolled into high school, which is from Grade 9 through 12. When students reach the 12th grade, they have completed their required education. Beyond the 12th grade, furthering your education is optional.\nAt college level in California, the state offers three options to continue your academic career. They are the Community College system, the California State University system, and the University of California system. Each system is unique. Where a student enrolls depends on the student and what that student's goals are. These are the choices students have for their education. However, there is another choice available, which is a private school. Private schools operate much like public schools with some differences. It is important  to look into all your options to see what the best options for you are.",

        "content": "Many students in the United States school system have set professional goals for themselves after their academic careers are over. The U.S. has an extensive network of colleges and universities spread out throughout the country. The common denominator every one of these schools has is the Grade Point Average (GPA). This statistic is used to help select students who apply to an institution of higher learning.\nA student's GPA is a strong indicator of how he or she will perform at the university level, but it is not the only thing universities measure. Many other factors come into play when a person applies for entrance to a university. Extracurricular activities, community involvement, and personal hardships are all considered in the application process. However, the first thing schools look at is the GPA.\nGPAs in the U.S. are a standardized method of measuring a student's academic performance. It is based on a 4.0 scale, and works together with the A to F grading system. Generally speaking, an A grade will earn the student a 4.0 GPA. If the student receives a B, then his or her GPA comes in at 3.0. C grades equal a 2.0, D 1.0 and an F grade is 0.0... If a student takes four classes, and receives two A's, one B and a C, his or her GPA would be 3.25, which is acceptable at many schools, but not all. The best thing to do is to try to get as many A grades as possible to increase your chances at getting into a highly-rated school. The top universities in the country require a GPA of at least 3.5, but it is best to get as close to 4.0 as possible. Most students who apply at top-rated universities have well over a 3.5 GPA.",

This measure of a student's academic performance is an important factor when he or she decides to apply to a university. It is, however, not the only consideration. One of the most important factors universities look at is the student's extracurricular activities. Extracurricular activities are simply the work students do outside his or her academic studies. These activities can include joining campus groups or clubs; community involvement, organizing or participating in social or politically-themed events, or fundraising for a cause important to that student. Extracurricular activities take many forms, and are important to achieving the student's academic goals.\nOne of the easiest ways to get involved in extracurricular activities is to simply join a campus club. There are many clubs on campus that might interest students. To find a list of the clubs your high school or college has to offer, go to the Associated Student Union, a student government organization, to ask for a list. Additionally, nearly every department has a club associated with it. For instance, the Psychology Department probably has a psychology club. The Engineering Department will also have a club or two. The same goes for Math and English Departments, but there are many more available to choose from.\nCommunity involvement is another good way to show university officials your extracurricular activities. There are countless volunteer opportunities students can engage in, which help both the community and the student. Working with the homeless, or disabled residents of the community looks good on a college application. Getting politically involved with a cause or a specific political candidate can also show university officials your commitment to improving your life, and the lives of others. The more a student is involved in extracurricular activities, the better.",

They are the community college system, which has more than 113 schools statewide, the 23 Cal State Universities, and the 10 University of California schools. Each school is unique from the other. The community college system can be seen as a stepping stone for admittance into a Cal State, or UC school. They offer lower-division classes that are transferable to both university systems. Cal State schools are more education-based, while UCs are more research-based schools, so where a student attends after high school or community college depends on the individual.\nOne other option exists for those seeking a college education. It is vocational school. Vocational schools are generally not part of California's, public school system although there are exceptions. Some of the Cal States offer vocational courses in various fields. These schools include Cal Poly Pomona, Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, and Cal State Channel Islands. These three schools offer vocational training in specific areas that might appeal to some students.\nTraditional vocational schools can be found throughout the state. These schools offer classes in nearly all vocational studies, such as Automotive Technology, Information Technology, and technical trainings in the medical field. Vocational schools can be an attractive option for some students who do not want to commit to a 4-year college program. Students who attend these schools can earn both degrees and certificates in their chosen fields in as little as six months to a couple of years depending on the course of study.

It is the second most important decision you will make as a parent - apart from deciding to have children in the first place. It is a very personal decision that is based on many factors. Some of those factors are having a strong teacher and child relationship, ensuring the school you choose is proficient in Math and English studies, and picking a school your child is comfortable with.\nThe connection between a child and a teacher is more important than any curriculum. Think of it this way: your 3 or 4-year-old is accustomed to being surrounded by loving people like his or her parents or siblings throughout the day, and the school is your children's first time to spend a large portion of their day away from those people; you want to look for a preschool teacher who is good with students, takes pride in his or her students' progress, and is consistently open to their improvement. The only way to know all this is to talk to your teacher.\nEnglish and Math proficiency is the key to a successful academic career. It is okay to ask about a school's success rate in these two critical areas. Pick a school that has shown a solid history of student academic success in these subjects. If a school is good at teaching these basic skills, then there is a good chance your child will benefit from it. Another thing to remember is your child's feelings. Children are more perceptive than you may realize, and they lack the ability to successfully communicate this to adults. So talk to your child, ask them how they feel about the school, and listen carefully to what they say.",

The Affordable Care Act (ACA) was signed into law in March 2010 by President Barack Obama, and came into effect in January 2015. The Act provided insurance to 20 to 24 million Americans who previously had no health insurance. This Act has come under a lot of criticism and is currently being reviewed with the intention of repealing it. The new U.S. Congress is planning on replacing the Act with a new one.\nHealthcare is very expensive in the United States. Hospital stays for even a few days can cost much more than most Americans can afford. Still there exists a complex network of clinics, offices, medical centers, hospitals, and outpatient facilities that are available to the public. Additionally, there are county hospitals and other low-cost facilities that can provide service to the insured and uninsured alike. Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) also provide medical services to the public. These HMOs are usually tied to employer insurance coverage, but individuals can purchase insurance from these types of healthcare providers, too.\nFinding a good doctor, one that you feel comfortable with, is the first step in taking command of your healthcare. Once you find a good doctor, he or she can refer you to specialists who can address any special needs you may have. You can find a good doctor anywhere in the U.S. regardless of your insurance plans. All you need is a little patience and persistence.\nMost people in the U.S. do not rely on the Affordable Care Act for their healthcare needs.

The reason for this is because most prescription drugs are more potent than the so-called over-the-counter drugs. Prescribed drugs are usually focused on a specific ailment, and come with side-effects that can cause other issues to the patient.\nLabels on prescribed medicines also contain other vital information such as the number of pills in the container, the date issued, the number of times you can reorder the prescription, the name of the drug along with the name of the pharmacy that issued the drug. This information is important because of the nature of most prescription drugs and their side effects. Some side effects could impair the patient severely. The drug could make you nauseous, or impair your vision. Some can also make you drowsy, which means the patient should not drive a car, or operate machinery. It could be dangerous to the patient, or to others that may be nearby.\nIt is good to know exactly what prescribed medicines you are taking. If you are ever in need of emergency medical treatment, this information is important to the medical personnel treating you. Some drugs do not interact well with others.

Vaccinations are preventive medical procedures that come in the form of an injection. Most children in the United States are required by law to be vaccinated for certain diseases that are easily transmitted from one person to another. Vaccinating children starts shortly after birth. The typical vaccinations include injections to prevent Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, and Polio. They stop the spread of measles, mumps, and chickenpox. These diseases were a big problem in the U.S. in the past, but they have all been eliminated through vaccinations. So if you are not certain if you have had your vaccinations, go see a medical professional.\nGetting a regular medical check-up is also important for maintaining good health. Doctors are highly-trained individuals whose only concern is to ensure their patients' health. It is always easier to practice preventive medicine than to treat an illness once the patient has received it. Preventive medicine is best served by getting regular check-ups. Most doctors want to see their patients every three to six months. By seeing their patients frequently, a doctor can determine slight changes in the overall health of their patients before they become a problem. Usually a check-up will include taking blood and urine samples for analysis. Many illnesses can be revealed through these tests and if caught early, are easily treatable. So make that appointment with your doctor, and if you do not have one, ask a friend, colleague, or family member, for a referral.

The foods to avoid are fatty foods and processed foods that contain a lot of empty calories and little nutritional value. Your health depends on the foods you put into your body, so think twice before consuming something that is unhealthful.\nMost nutritionists agree that vegetables are a key to living a long, healthy life. Nearly all vegetables are low in fat and calories and are a major source of a variety of nutrients. Many vegetables provide potassium, dietary fiber, and vitamins A and C. Vegetables are so low in calories that it is nearly impossible to gain weight by overeating them. Of course, this only applies to non-battered vegetables. It does not apply to deep-fried vegetables, or vegetables that are used as part of a larger meal that may include cheese, or other fatty components. Generally speaking, the most popular vegetables contain only about 50 calories per cup, and they are very filling.\nEating lots of fruit can also be low-calorie alternative to fatty foods that consist of red meat such as hamburgers or sausages. Fruits contain natural sugar, which is healthier for the human body than processed sugar. Legumes and nuts are also healthy for the body, but contain more calories than fruits and vegetables, so be careful with how much you eat. The best thing to do is to educate yourself on the foods you eat. Knowing beforehand what you are putting into your body can help you make the correct food choices.",

Tough love is usually defined as letting your children learn about life through their own experiences, whether they are good experiences or not. Then there is the over-nurturing type of parenting. This is where the parents micro-manage their children's activities, and praise and encourage them regardless of their performances. Some would argue that this approach does not prepare children for the real world, others argue that it is the job of the parent to protect their children. The debate can last indefinitely.\nSome of the pitfalls of parenthood are mistreating their children, and committing child abuse. The definition of child abuse has changed greatly over the years.

Humor has been known to relieve stress also.\nHumor is everywhere. For example, laughter is one of the first things you do as a newborn, and, if all goes well, it will be one of the last things you do before you die. If you try going through a day without a laugh, you'll find that it's downright impossible. Humor is also not exclusively a human experience. Many creatures in the animal kingdom have been observed engaging in humor and laughter. Additionally, humor influences many of our daily decisions such as the websites, books, and magazines we read, the television shows and movies we watch, and the people we decide to talk to or not. The importance of humor cannot be understated.\nHumor has physical benefits, too. Laughter, especially a hearty laugh, has been shown to benefit your circulation, lungs, and muscles, especially muscles around the belly area. Humor also helps people deal with pain and physical adversity. It has been discovered that humor improves the overall makeup of the human psyche when used during times of grief  such as a death in the family.

        "content": "Politically Correct is a term that has gained a great deal of momentum during the last few years in the United States. It is a term that describes the behavior  people exhibit in public versus in private social situations. It is a relatively new term that has drawn both criticism and praise from many Americans. Being politically correct is achieved by speaking about something or someone in public without being disrespectful. This applies even if you are speaking on a topic that you disagree with. It is very closely related to politeness, but has more meaning than simply being polite.\nIn the past, it was considered acceptable to speak your mind when discussing politics or religion, for example. This type of candor sometimes created a conflict between the speaker and those listening who may disagree with him or her. An example of this may be if someone is speaking about the current President in an offensive manner in public. There are those who support the President and may not share the speaker's point of view. On the other side of the argument, it could be you who is in a group of people expressing views about the President that you may not agree on. Is it better to confront the speaker or to simply remove yourself from the situation? Being around people who do not practice political correctness can be uncomfortable.\nThe best way to go about your day is to speak of controversial subjects privately with friends or family. Some political and religious feelings are deeply rooted in some people who may not feel comfortable about a person speaking against his or her beliefs. This can lead to confrontation, and even conflict. The best way to proceed is to be careful of the topics you engage in conversations on when you are out in public.",

        "content": "Society in the United States is a complex matter. It is unique even among English-speaking countries. What is acceptable behavior or language in Australia, for example, may not be in the USA. Taboos are defined as socially unacceptable language, or behavior. There are simply some words and actions that society members cannot do in public. It is important to learn some of the taboos that exist in this country, especially for those who are new here. It will make the transition from your country of origin to the United States a little bit easier. The following are a few examples of American taboos.\nOne of the most common taboos in the U.S. is the use of profanity. Profanity, sometimes called cuss words, or swear words, is not considered proper conversation in some parts of the country. In large cities such as Los Angeles or New York, profanity is more common, but in much of the rural part of the country, it is considered vulgar and the person using profanity is considered of low quality. Another American taboo is speaking of the Christian God in a casual fashion. Religious beliefs run strong in the South and Midwest regions. Using the name of Jesus Christ or God will definitely be looked down upon in these areas.\nOther taboo subjects in the U.S. are sex, death, personal finances, and excretory functions. Excretory functions are body functions that involve waste materials. It is improper to speak of your personal bathroom visits, especially to the opposite sex. Personal finances are just that personal, and should never be discussed in social settings. It is no one's business how much money you make, or inquiring about how much money someone else makes. The same is true about sexual content. Lastly, it is considered in poor taste to speak badly about a deceased person.",

This practice will serve you well in both your academic and professional careers. Being punctual is possibly the single, most important thing for any job you may have. It is something that most employers expect from their employees, and it is also what many professors expect from their students.\nNothing disrupts a class more than a latecomer who habitually comes into the classroom late. Coming in 5 to 10 minutes late draws attention to the person coming in late, and interrupts the teacher who is trying to conduct a lesson. It also disturbs students who are concentrating on the professor's lecture. Being late is rude and looked down upon in American society. It also serves as a disadvantage to the person coming in late. If a student arrives 10 minutes late, he or she may miss an assignment, or roll call. Roll is called generally at the beginning of a class and who is not. It also can indicate who comes in late to class. You don't want to get the bad reputation of always coming in late to class. So leave home a few minutes earlier to ensure you won't miss any class time. It is a good habit to get into because punctuality is important in the workforce.\nGenerally speaking, most employers set specific times for their employees to arrive to the workplace. Normally the workplace is in an office or factory, but sometimes could be at a remote location. Regardless of where your particular workplace is, it is important to arrive on time, or preferably a few minutes early. This shows your employer that you are a good employee who can be counted on to be at work. So be on time, and you will benefit greatly from this.",

During the country's infancy, most immigrants came from European countries such as England, Germany, Italy, and France, but that changed in the years that followed. Although many people still come from those countries into the U.S., many other countries are represented here. Immigrants from Latin America, Africa, and Asia have also relocated to the United States, and now call this country their home. With all the diverse cultures that exist in this country, it is important to recognize their differences and try to get along with everyone.\nAsian cultures differ greatly from Latin American cultures, or European cultures. Language, food, marriage, and interactions within their culture can be very different. What is acceptable behavior in one culture may not be in another, or may even be considered rude, or taboo. Japanese people, for example, usually greet each other with a slight nod of the head, and a bow from the waist. This is considered a formal method of greeting someone new in Japan. In American culture, people normally look directly into the other person's eyes and use their right hand to grasp the other person's right hand firmly. An up-and-down motion is then employed. This is called shaking hands. A firm handshake is considered a favorable way to meet someone new in America. Other cultures use other methods to greet each other, and there are countless cultures in the United States.\nTake advantage of the different cultures of the country. Learning a new language, or having a meal that is unique to another culture can be a great experience. Embrace the customs of your fellow Americans. You may find it much enjoyable.",

People in the U.S. are free to practice the religion of their choice without fear of persecution. Religious persecution was one of the main reasons many immigrants fled their countries to live in the United States. Various religious faiths have flourished within the United States. A majority of Americans report that religion plays a very important role in their lives, a proportion unique among developed countries. Christianity is the most popular religion in the country, but it is not the only one practiced here by far.\nDuring the country's infancy, Anglicans, Roman Catholics, and mainline Protestants, as well as Jews, arrived from Europe. Various Protestants, who left the Church of England, greatly diversified the religious landscape. Methodist and Baptist churches increased drastically. Jehovah's Witnesses and the Latter Day Saint movement spread also. Beginning in 1990s, the religious share of Christians is decreasing due to secularization, while Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, and other religions are spreading.  Protestantism, historically dominant, ceased to be the religious category of the majority in the early 2010s. What is most important, however, is that all religions are safe to practice in the United States.\nChristianity is not the only religion to see a decline in membership in recent years. Nearly all religions are shrinking in size because of the country's move to a more secular way of life. Atheism is on the rise in the country as the number of people who claim to be atheist or to have no religious connection is increasing.",

Public libraries are distinct from research libraries, school libraries, and other special libraries in that their mandate is to serve the general public's information needs rather than the needs of a particular school, institution, or research population. Public libraries also provide free services such as preschool story times to encourage early literacy. They also provide quiet study and work areas for students and professionals, or book clubs to encourage appreciation of literature in adults. Public libraries typically allow users to borrow books and other materials temporarily; they also have non-circulating reference collections and provide computer and Internet access to patrons.\nThe computer access is one of the ways that public libraries have evolved. The Internet has opened up an entire world of information, which is much larger than any single library can provide. The inclusions of digital library databases have increased the number of books, periodicals, and videos available to the public. Libraries are great places for people to study, to do research, or just to read a book.",

Millions of American individuals, businesses, and other government agencies depend on the USPS to deliver mail, documents, and packages countrywide on a daily basis.\nEach day the USPS delivers approximately 660 million pieces of mail to as many as 142 million delivery points. It operates 31,000 post offices and locations in the U.S., and delivers 155 billion pieces of mail each year. The basic rate to deliver First-Class Mail (no more than 1 ounce) is 49 cents, so mailing a letter to anyone in the United States will cost you less than 50 cents, regardless of its destination. Additionally, the USPS owns one of the largest civilian vehicle fleets in the nation, which helped it earn the total revenue of more than $74.49 billion in 2016.\nAlthough the USPS is one of the largest government agencies in existence, it has been negatively affected by the advent of the World Wide Web, and email. These two factors have led to a decline of volume since 1998. In response, the USPS announced it would close more than half  of its mail processing centers, eliminate 28,000 jobs, and reduce overnight delivery of First-Class Mail.

There were three major TV networks at the time: NBC, CBS, and ABC. All these networks still exist, but have been joined  with several other TV viewing options over the years. One of the first alternatives for television viewing is cable TV. It has been in existence for quite some time. Cable TV served much of the country's rural areas during the time the networks ruled TV. Network TV is broadcast through airwaves, and private homes receive the broadcast using an antenna affixed on the home's roof. Cable TV is a system where the cable company used cable to link several homes together to receive broadcast signals from a central antenna.\nCable TV offered more than network channels did. Soon the demand for cable TV grew in populated areas. Cable TV was allowed to show more graphic content also, which was attractive to some viewers who did not agree with the censorship network TV was subjected to. Needless to say, cable TV became quite popular because it offered more channels than over-the-air broadcast TV. Some of these channels were designed to attract specific audiences such as sports, movies, and uncensored TV fans. Soon cable TV was in nearly all the homes in the United States.\nFollowing the popularity of cable TV, satellite television came onto the scene. It offered multiple channels, just like cable, but was delivered via orbiting satellites making it possible to view live programming from virtually any part of the world. Today, streaming services are popular. These services offer TV content through Wi-Fi connections, which costs substantially less than either cable or satellite service.

Parks have many features designed to give the most options possible to park visitors.  How a park shapes up depends greatly on the natural environment it is located in. It may consist of grassy areas, rocks, soil, and trees, but may also contain buildings and other artifacts such as monuments, fountains, or playground structures. Many parks have fields for playing sports such as football and baseball. They may also have paved areas for games such as basketball. Many parks have trails for walking, biking, and other activities. Often, the smallest parks are in urban areas, where a park may take up only a city block or less. Urban parks often have benches for sitting, and may contain picnic tables and barbecue grills.\nAdditionally, many parks engage the community by providing venues for recreation and events. Many parks hold outdoor concerts where visitors can enjoy live entertainment. Parks are traditionally selected to host traveling carnival shows. These carnivals have mechanical rides that people can enjoy for a small fee. Carnivals also have game booths, video games, and food available. Parks are sometimes divided into active and passive recreation areas. Active recreation involves cooperative or team activity, including playgrounds, ball fields, swimming pools, gymnasiums, and skate parks. Active recreation such as team sports, due to the need to provide substantial space to congregate, typically involves intensive management, maintenance, and high costs. Passive recreation, also called \"low intensity recreation\", emphasizes the open-space aspect of a park and allows for the preservation of natural habitat.

Thrift stores usually offer second-hand or used clothing and goods for sale at a greatly reduced price. These stores can be found in nearly every community in the country. Some people visit thrift stores out of necessity, because of the low prices, but others like to shop at thrift stores because of the hidden gems sometimes found there. Thrift stores depend on donations from private citizens to stock their stores. Many times a person will donate a piece of clothing, or an article from their home without realizing its real value. This is where some eagle-eyed thrift shop patrons pick up their hidden prizes.\nGarage sales work much the same as thrift shops do, but they are not usually in a fixed location. Many people hold garage sales in their private garages. These sales take place for several reasons. One is that people need to get their hands on a little extra cash, but a more important reason is that people have bulging houses. Their homes are too small to accommodate all their goods. A garage sale consists of items the owners no longer want or need. They want to rid themselves of unused or unwanted items, and pick up a few bucks in the process.\nMost cities require homeowners who are planning to host a garage sale to purchase a special permit. These permits make it legal to sell their goods for one day, or sometimes an entire weekend. The cost of the permit is nominal. It can cost as little as $5 to $10 to acquire a garage sale permit, and it might be well worth the expense.",

Banking, credit card, and personal information all exists in cyberspace today, and there are thieves out there who know how to access it.\nIn order to keep your information safe, try following basic safety practices such as installing protective software, and creating strong passwords. Use a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters to create a password that is easy for you to remember. Additionally, regular backups can protect you from the unexpected. Don't leave your computer in an unsecured area, unattended, or logged on, especially in public places. Ignore unsolicited emails, and be wary of attachments, links, and forms in emails that come from people you don't know, and avoid untrustworthy websites. Never give your passwords to other people.

The cabinet acts as agents of the U.S. President, and carry out the duties they are entrusted with.\nThe legislative branch of government consists of the House of Representatives, and the Senate.

It can also  declare war, and raise and support the army, navy, and air force to protect the country.

Most people continue partying well after midnight into the wee hours of the first day of the new year. In fact, many New Year's parties include breakfast or brunch. Sometimes at the stroke of midnight there will be fireworks and couples often kiss. One of the most famous New Year's celebrations takes place in New York City's Time Square, where a huge cut crystal ball drops at midnight in front of millions of people standing in the cold. Many more millions watch on television. Some groups, called Polar Bear Clubs, jump into the cold ocean water on New Year's Day as a literal way  to start the new year fresh.\nNew Year's Day, January 1, is a national holiday in the United States. This means that schools, banks, government offices, and post offices are closed. Given how much people tend to drink alcohol on New Year's Eve, many people wake up on New Year's Day with a hangover. The national holiday is a good day to recover.\nMany people go out partying with their friends on New Year's Eve; many people use New Year's Day to visit family members. New Year's Day is also when many people start on their New Year's resolutions. A resolution is a promise to change a lifestyle habit. The most common resolution is to lose weight. Many people also join gyms as part of their resolutions.\nOn New Year's Day there are also parades such as the famous Tournament of Roses Parade in Pasadena, California, where all the floats are made of different colored roses and they compete for awards. Many people also watch college and professional football games, including the Rose Bowl, which is also held in Pasadena, California.",

        "content": "The third Monday in January is an American federal holiday, Martin Luther King Jr. Day. It falls near the birthday of the civil rights leader, who was assassinated in 1968. King, a minister, became known for non-violently protesting the treatment of African-Americans in the United States and laws that discriminated against Blacks. Specifically, King protested segregation that separated blacks and whites in public restrooms, public pools, public schools,  on buses, and at restaurants. King led many marches in the United States, especially in the South where segregation was especially practiced and enforced, and in Washington D.C. His march on Washington D.C. was perhaps his most famous one, where he gave the \"I have a Dream\" speech.\nOn Martin Luther King Jr. Day, federal, state, and local offices are closed, including public schools and post offices. On the holiday many people participate in marches and vigils remembering Dr. King. Others use the day as a day of service and volunteer in their community by cleaning up garbage in a local park or serving food to the homeless. However,  the holiday was controversial. Some states didn't want to honor Dr. King and tried to  rename the holiday or combine the day with another holiday.\nOnly two other people have a U.S. national holiday, Christopher Columbus and George Washington. Martin Luther King Jr. Day  became a holiday in 1983 after pressure from civil rights activists and marches, similar to the ones King used to lead. Efforts to create a King holiday began the same year King was killed. The first state to recognize King Day as a holiday was Illinois. The last state to recognize the holiday was Arizona.",

Most people think of it as a romantic day to show the one you love how much you care by purchasing cards and gifts. Valentine's Day is also an extremely commercial holiday. People spend money on flowers, balloons, chocolate, stuffed animals, and jewelry. People also go out for expensive dinners. Valentine's Day is even celebrated by school children, who give thank-you cards to their teachers. Some high schools have Valentine's Day dances. Classmates give each other little cards. These cards can be purchased at any store with famous cartoon characters. It is considered much more thoughtful to have kids make handmade cards to give to friends and teachers.\nValentine's Day is also a great day to announce your love to someone like a secret crush. Some people even get married on Valentine's Day. However, you don't have to be in love to share in the festivities. You can say \"Happy Valentine's Day\" to friends and coworkers.\nValentine's Day is not an official holiday though in the U.S., meaning government offices and schools are open as usual. The date used to be the celebration of a Saint named Valentine who allegedly saved a young girl's life. It wasn't until the Middle Ages that romance somehow got mixed in with the date and lovers would send each other handwritten love notes. Back then you couldn't just go to the store and buy a card  the way you can now.\nYou know Valentine's Day is around the corner when stores begin to decorate with red and pink hearts and the symbol of Cupid, a winged ancient Roman god said to strike the hearts of people with his arrow. Now it seems Cupid goes straight after your wallet because you will also see many more jewelry ads as Valentine's Day approaches.",

According to the legend, St. Patrick drove all the snakes out of Ireland. St. Patrick's Day has also become, especially in the United States, a day to celebrate Irish culture. In major cities across the country like in New York and Boston, there are parades and festivals. People wear green and decorate with shamrocks, a type of three-leaf clover. Some people wear buttons or tee shirts that say \"Kiss me, I'm Irish\". In the U.S. St. Patrick's Day is not a legal holiday, meaning government offices and schools are open.\nThe biggest and oldest parade takes place in New York City. It actually began about 250 years ago before the U.S. was even its own country. Every year thousands gather along to watch hundreds of Irish step dancers and bagpipe players march. Irish step dancing is done in groups or solo. Dancers perform complicated moves with their feet and legs while keeping their upper bodies stiff. The parade has also been a source of controversy because the parade is associated with the Catholic Church in New York City; gay and lesbian organizations have not been allowed to march. Many people protest the parade or boycott it.\nSt. Patrick's Day has also become associated with the drinking of a lot of alcohol, specifically beer. One drink that is often seen around the holiday is \"Green Beer\". This is really  just regular beer with green food coloring. Many people feel like the holiday celebrates stereotypes about the Irish, like the myth that they all like to drink and get drunk. Others complain that the holiday has become too focused on drinking, with public drunkenness as a problem in major cities around the holiday.",

It is traditionally                     celebrated in the spring                     and lasts about a week.\nAccording to the story                         in the Bible,                         God punished ancient Egypt                         with 10 plagues.                         The last plague                         killed Egyptian first-born males.                         Jewish people were told                         to mark their doors                         with lamb's blood                         so that God would know                         to pass over these houses                         and not kill                         any first-born males inside.                         This is where                         the name of the holiday,                         Passover, comes from.                         After this last plague                         the Egyptian king,                         known as the Pharaoh,                         agreed to release                         the ancient Jews                         from bondage.                         The Bible story also says                         that the Jewish people                         left their homes                         in such a rush                         after they were freed                         that they didn't have time                         to wait for the bread                         to rise.                         This is why                         at the commemorative Passover meal,                         Jewish people                         eat matzo,                         bread without yeast,                         also known as                         unleavened bread.                         The matzo and other foods                         are eaten                         at a special meal                         called a seder.\nThere are                         very specific rituals                         that happen                         at the Seder meal.                         These rituals                         are all in a book                         called the Haggadah.                         Inside the Haggadah                         is also the story                         of the Jewish exodus                         from Egypt.                         During the seder meal                         parts of the Haggadah                         are read aloud.                         The first part of the meal                         is a blessing                         over wine.                         The second part of the meal                         is the washing of hands.                         The third part of the meal                         is when someone                         dips some sort of vegetable                         in salt water                         and then                         eats the vegetable.                         The vegetable symbolizes                         the humble origins                         of the Jewish people.                         The water symbolizes                         their tears.                         The fourth part of the meal                         is when three pieces of matzo                         are broken.",

Some Christians participate in an Easter vigil or nighttime mass, sometimes held by candlelight. Easter is never on a set date. It is observed on a Sunday between the end of March and the end of April. The exact date is calculated based on a different calendar. Many public schools in the U.S. have a week-long vacation around Easter time. Sometimes this break is called Easter or Spring break.\nIn the United States, Easter is also celebrated as a secular holiday. It is associated with the beginning of spring and symbolized by bunnies, flowers, and dyed eggs. Many children in the U.S. believe in a fictional character called the Easter Bunny. According to the myth the Easter Bunny leaves baskets full of candy for children. Sometimes these baskets are hidden and the children have to find them on Easter Sunday morning. Candy that is usually inside an Easter basket can include chocolate in the shape of bunnies or chicks, jellybeans, and marshmallows.\nAnother activity associated with Easter is an Easter egg hunt. According to popular mythology, the Easter Bunny hides painted eggs and children need to find them. While real eggs used to be used, now it is common to use plastic eggs filled with candy. There are usually public Easter egg hunts in parks across the country. The White House even hosts an Easter egg hunt. Another Easter tradition associated with Easter is dying real eggs in different, usually pastel, colors like light pink, blue and yellow.\nIn New York City, people take to Fifth Avenue to participate in the Easter Parade. The Easter Parade isn't a parade with marching bands and floats. People walk up and down Fifth Avenue showing off elaborately decorated hats or Easter bonnets.",

It became an official holiday in the country at the start of the 20th century as a way to honor mothers whose sons had died in war.\nThe holiday is celebrated in a number of ways.  People give mothers gifts like flowers, cards, and jewelry to thank them for all their hard work. A popular symbol of the holiday is the carnation. This is because when the holiday first began in the U.S. people were encouraged to wear a red carnation if their mother was alive or a white carnation if their mother was dead. Many people take their mothers out for a special meal. In fact, Mother's Day is the most popular date in the U.S. for people to go out and eat and it is estimated that people spend billions on meals and gifts. Mother's Day is also the most popular day to make long distance calls in the U.S. It is the second most popular gift-giving day after Christmas.\nSince its establishment, Mother's Day has been criticized for becoming highly commercialized. In fact, the founder of the U.S. holiday, Anna Jarvis, began protesting the holiday and was even arrested for disturbing the peace for demonstrating. Jarvis's own mother started the campaign to establish a mother's holiday during the American Civil War.\nMothers are not the only people celebrated on this day. All mother figures including grandmothers, great-grandmothers, stepmothers, and foster mothers are honored on the holiday. In schools many students make special gifts, including handmade cards. While widely recognized, Mother's Day is not a federal holiday. Many other countries around the world have their own version of Mother's Day.",

It is observed on the third Sunday in June.\nIn the early 20th century there was a mining accident in West Virginia that killed almost 400 men. A push for a day to remember the men killed, who were mostly husbands and fathers, was the start of a push for a national holiday. This was in 1908. It wasn't until 1972, however, that Father's Day was recognized by law as a national holiday. This is due in part to the fact that people were resistant to what they saw as another overly invented holiday meant to just make people spend money. It wasn't seen as a way to remember the dead or to honor living fathers and father figures. People weren't entirely wrong. Organizations representing men's clothing manufacturers put in a lot of money for the holiday to become popular.\nLike Mother's Day, it indeed is a holiday that has become highly commercialized. There are greeting cards to mark the day, and stores advertise gifts for Dad. These gifts traditionally include electronics, ties, and tools. In schools, children often make cards and other gifts. Father's Day is not a federal holiday even though it is widely celebrated.

Memorial Day has its roots in the U.S. Civil War when a holiday, Decoration Day, was established to honor both Union and Confederate soldiers who died.

The most well-known one is held in Arlington National Cemetery near Washington D.C. Arlington is a military cemetery, meaning only military personnel are buried there. Volunteers place U.S. flags on military graves at Arlington and other national cemeteries. There are also parades in honor of fallen service people held in different towns and cities. Another Memorial Day tradition is flying the U.S. flag at half staff until noon, meaning it is flown at half its normal height. This is considered a sign of mourning.

Some states like South Dakota do not observe the holiday at all. Instead they call the day Native American Day or Indigenous Peoples' Day. In Hawaii the holiday is also known as Landing Day or Discoverer's Day. This is because European arrival in North America meant the loss of land and lives for many Native people.

In the U.S. though, the focus is less on memories of the dearly departed or agriculture. It is about kids dressing up in scary costumes and going door-to-door asking for candy. This is called trick-or-treating.\nWhen children knock on the door of a house or ring the doorbell, they usually say \"Trick or Treat\". The \"trick\" part is a fake threat signaling that the kids will commit a prank if they aren't given something delicious. Homeowners then give the children candy, raisins, or some other food treat. Many homeowners decorate their houses to prepare for the holiday and let kids know that they are participating and can ring the bell for candy. Traditional decorations often include jack-o'-lanterns, which are pumpkins with faces carved into them and candles inside. Jack-o' lanterns were thought to scare away evil spirits when Halloween was first celebrated among the ancient Christians. Also turnips, not pumpkins, were originally used. People often decorate using the colors black and orange.\nHalloween is not just for kids;  adults get in on the fun by attending costume parties. There are often contests for who has the best costume. There are also games bobbing for apples, where people have to get an apple using only their teeth from a large bucket of water. Other people celebrate by scaring themselves by going to haunted houses, homes where people dressed up as ghosts, zombies, and werewolves and jump out to frighten guests.

This candelabra is called a menorah. Now there are also electric menorahs. Some people also use oil lamps. The 9th candle space is usually higher than the others and is lit on every night. This 9th candle is there so that people can see the other candles they are lighting. So, two lights are lit on the first night, three on the second and so on. Some families have the head of household light the candles. Other families share the responsibility. The menorah is supposed to be placed somewhere visible like in a window facing the street. The candles are supposed to stay lit for at least 30 minutes after it gets dark. There are also special prayers people say and holy songs sung when the candles are lit.\nSchools and government offices are open for Hanukkah since the observances happen at night. Some families exchange gifts on each night of the holiday. Some foods traditionally eaten on Hanukkah include latkes, fried potato pancakes, and doughnuts. These and other fried foods are eaten because they are cooked in oil and remind people of the oil that lasted for 8 nights. Children play with a special four-sided spinning top called a dreidel.",

In the United States it is celebrated on the fourth Thursday in November and marks the start of the Christmas season. Some people celebrate Thanksgiving to remember the first harvest of the pilgrims and puritans, groups of people from England who immigrated to North America in the 1600s. Some people recreate the first Thanksgiving and dress up as pilgrims, puritans, and the Native Americans who are said to have helped the new arrivals find food to survive their first winter.\nMost people, however, see Thanksgiving as one day a year to reflect upon what they are thankful for. Some families will sit together and take turns saying aloud what they are thankful for. An important part of Thanksgiving is families coming together. Extended family members often travel long distances to share the day with their loved ones. In the United States Thanksgiving is the busiest travel day of the year. People travel in planes, trains, buses, and cars to share a very special meal  - Thanksgiving dinner.\nWhat most Thanksgiving celebrations have in common is the food. On Thanksgiving many families prepare large, elaborate dinners to share with friends and loved ones. Many of these dinners use ingredients associated with the fall harvest, like cranberries, potatoes, sweet potatoes, corn, and blueberries. Roast turkey is the traditional meat served. It is so common that some people call Thanksgiving Day \"Turkey Day\". The turkey is usually served with gravy and stuffing. Pies are usually served for dessert. The most common pies served are sweet potato, apple, pecan, and pumpkin.\nThanksgiving is not just celebrated in the privacy of people's homes. Every year the President of the United States pardons a turkey, saving it from becoming someone's meal. In New York City, Macy's, a department store, holds a large parade with huge balloons of various cartoon characters floating down the street.",

Licensed stores sell numbered tickets, or people can pay to choose their own numbers. When you let a machine pick your numbers, it is usually called a Quick Pick. Many people play lucky numbers, numbers associated with birthdates or other important numbers to them. The money earned from selling lottery tickets goes to pay for schools, roads, bridges, and other public services. Once a week or more, a drawing is held where the numbers are randomly picked. If your ticket has those numbers, you could win a cash prize.\nThere are different types of lotteries, such as Powerball, Mega Millions, and Lotto. Powerball and Mega Millions are known for their large payouts. There are also instant lottery tickets that are scratch-off cards. The winnings tend to be less money, but they are extremely popular.\nIn the United States, you can play the lottery, or buy a ticket if you are 18 years or older. If you win, usually you have the option of being paid the entire amount in one lump sum or of being paid smaller amounts over a number of years. Lottery winnings are taxable, meaning the amount you actually get is smaller than the jackpot number. People can buy lottery tickets or play the lottery at many convenience stores. Lotteries are also very popular since they advertise. There are many television commercials, radio commercials, and billboards urging people to play.\nLotteries have been controversial since they are essentially a form of legalized gambling. There is concern that it can lead to people becoming addicted to gambling. There are also illegal lottery games, usually run by some forms of organized crime.",

There are special forms the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the government agency in charge of collecting taxes, asks people to fill out. There are tax credits that people with low income, college students, and parents can get. These credits could mean actually getting money back from the government. This money is called a tax refund. People can get both a federal and state tax refund. Anyone who works has to be taxed regardless of the immigration status. Not paying income taxes could mean a fine or even jail time.\nPayroll taxes are taxes that are taken right out of a person's paycheck. There are federal and state payroll taxes. These include Social Security and Medicare taxes. Social Security taxes pay for the retirement and disability benefits received by millions of Americans each year. Medicare taxes pay for the federal health insurance program that covers the elderly and the disabled.\nPeople who own houses pay property taxes. The amount paid depends on how much the property is worth. This tax is usually paid once a year. Sales tax is a tax almost everyone pays. Sales tax is a specific extra percentage charged on nearly all purchases. Everything from soap to furniture has a sales tax attached when bought.

People can pay for medicine and doctor visits directly in cash or they can use health insurance. Health insurance usually means you pay less for these services. There are different types of health insurance. At some jobs, companies offer health insurance plans as part of a benefits package. Individuals can also buy health insurance. The elderly, and disabled can get government-run health insurance through programs like Medicaid and Medicare. There are many different health insurance companies or plans. Each health plan has a set of doctors they work with. Once a person picks a plan, they pay a premium, which is a fixed amount of money every month. Once in a plan, a person picks a doctor they want to see from that plan. That doctor is the person's primary care provider.\nObamacare, or the Affordable Care Act, is a recently passed law that makes it easier for people to get health insurance. The law requires all Americans have health insurance by 2014. Those that do not get health insurance by the end of the year will have to pay a fine in the form of an extra tax when they file their income taxes. Through Obamacare, people can still get insurance through their jobs, privately, or through Medicaid and Medicare. They can also buy health insurance through state marketplaces, where people can get help choosing a plan based on their income and health care needs. These marketplaces also create an easy way to compare what different plans offer. If people cannot afford to buy health insurance, they may qualify for government programs that offer free health insurance like Medicaid, Medicare, or for children, a special program called the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP).",

Since the founding of the country people have come from different countries in search of a better life and opportunities. Immigration laws, however, are always changing and are complicated. This leads to many people coming into the U.S. without proper legal status. While some people call immigrants who come and stay in the U.S. without the proper papers \"illegals\", many consider this term offensive. The more acceptable term is \"undocumented\" since they do not have the correct legal documents.\nIt is estimated that there are more than 11 million undocumented people in the Unites States. While some people will say there is no reason for immigrants to be undocumented in the U.S., there are limits on the number of Green Cards, or legal permanent  resident cards, people from certain countries can get. There are also long waiting lists, up to 14 years in some cases, for people coming from certain countries, to apply for legal status in the U.S. Additionally there are a limited amount of visas, or permits, for people coming into the U.S. with manual labor skills. Millions of undocumented people have been deported, or sent back to their country of origin under President Obama.\nIn 2013, the U.S. Senate passed an immigration reform bill. The law adds extra border security along the U.S.-Mexico border, and also makes it easier for immigrants to become citizens. The bill, which also has to be approved by the House of Representatives, has not yet been presented or voted on by Congress. Because of this, many are asking President Obama to take action to protect some of the undocumented, many of whom have been in the U.S. for many years and have children that are U.S. citizens.",

        "content": "The American community college system is a place for second chances. Community colleges are two-year schools that thrived in California after the end of World War II. Many American military personnel were returning to civilian life after their service to the country. Some of these young people decided not to go to college after high school so that they could serve their country during that time of need. When they returned, many of them turned to the community college system in California to continue their education.\nThe United States government introduced the G.I. Bill at that time giving returning servicemen and women educational benefits to help them get back to school. Soon community colleges and new school districts began appearing throughout the country. Community colleges helped ease returning military personnel back into college life. It was a low cost, less stressful alternative to going back to a four-year university.\nToday, community colleges attract students from all parts of the world. In California, a large population of students comes from Asia and Latin America. These schools provide a second chance to international students who may have experienced difficulties attending college in their native countries. American students who may have not done well academically in high school, and did not enter a university, can turn to community college for a second chance, too.\nCommunity colleges provide a much-needed resource for all these students. Former military personnel, international students, and high school students alike, are all welcome. One of the best things about community colleges is that they accept anyone at anytime. This means people who have not found what they want to do in life can try more than one area of study. If they don't like one course of study, they can always try something else. That is the beauty of community colleges.",

        "content": "These days many people attend community colleges with plans to transfer to a four-year college or university to get a bachelor's degree. It's kind of like a stepping-stone. There are many reasons why people do this. One reason is that some community colleges have transfer agreements with private and state colleges and universities that guarantee admission. Even if a community college doesn't have that agreement of a guaranteed spot in a four-year college, it has articulation agreements with four-year schools. These agreements tell you exactly what classes a student in a community college needs to take in order to be able to transfer. These agreements make sure that students don't waste time taking classes that won't transfer. Most of these classes one needs to take before transferring are general education classes, like math and English.\nAnother reason why many students start their undergraduate degree at a community college is a financial one. A four-year college or university is much more expensive than a two-year college. This is especially true for immigrant students, who don't qualify for financial aid, loans or scholarships. Also community colleges tend to offer more evening classes so they can accommodate people who have to work while attending school. They are also a good option for older students with families, who need a more flexible schedule while taking care of children. Community colleges also tend to be commuter schools, meaning people don't have to live on campus in dorms. Attending a community college means you can still live at home with your parents, which can save the family a huge amount of money.\nIf a student didn't do well in high school, a community college would provide him or her with another opportunity to enter a four-year university. Community colleges offer many classes to help students develop their math and writing skills. When you attend a four-year college, you are expected to have those skills already. Community college will prepare students to successfully graduate from a four-year school.",

Children also learn basic social studies or history, science, art, and music skills, and participate in gym or physical education. In elementary schools children also learn how to follow directions, share, and work in groups. Students usually stay in one classroom all day with one teacher who stays with them throughout the year. Students may leave the classroom to visit the school library, the school gym, and attend special science, art, and music classes. Students also usually leave the classroom for lunch and recess. For lunch students sit at tables, separated by grade, in a large cafeteria. Recess is usually a half hour when children go out into a yard to play. The typical school day starts at about 8:00 in the morning and ends at about 3:00 p.m. Students go to school from Monday to Friday and have the weekends off.\nElementary school teachers are licensed by the state where they work.

Homeschooling is also seen as a choice for families that live in rural areas, and families that travel, like actors.\nThere are many different ways to homeschool, and homeschooling allows parents to customize lessons based on their children's needs.

Some parents follow a philosophy called unschooling, which allows a child to determine when, and how they want to learn based on their natural curiosity.

Other people take selfies to show what they are wearing or whom they are hanging out with.\nThe most common way to take a selfie is by holding a cell phone at arm's length. Some people take selfies by taking a picture of their reflection in a mirror. In these pictures, you can usually see the phone the person is taking a picture with. Selfies taken using a mirror often are taken in a bathroom, which some people think is offensive. The bathroom is a very private place, not a place to take pictures.\nSome people think that selfies are a sign that people are becoming vain or superficial. It is not often that people take pictures of themselves that make them look bad. When people take pictures of themselves, they usually are trying to present themselves in the best light. However, some people use selfies to show what they really look like. Some people are trying to challenge stereotypes of what makes someone attractive.",

        "content": "In U.S. cities like New York City and Los Angeles, many people live in small apartments. Despite not having homes with big yards, some apartment dwellers still seek the companionship that domesticated animals like dogs and cats offer. Some people feel that having a pet, even in a small space, is good for teaching children responsibility.\nHowever, many landlords forbid tenants from having pets, specifically cats and dogs, because of the damage the animals can do to carpets. Some landlords even forbid birds because of the noise they make. Many landlords charge an extra fee, known as a pet deposit, to tenants who want to keep pets. This is to pay for repairs or cleaning caused by the pet.\nMany times apartment dwellers will choose animals, like fish, hermit crabs, guinea pigs or hamsters, that make little noise, little mess, and won't chew up the furniture. Other people keep lizards as pets, since they don't require much space and can be kept in small cages or tanks. Another benefit of these smaller pets is that they don't need to be walked. However, some people who live in apartments have pets that are not so ordinary. Some of these less than ordinary pets include mammals like hedgehogs, amphibians like frogs, and spiders like tarantulas. Not all exotic pets are legal though.\nIn order to maintain public safety, some cities and states have laws banning specific animals as pets. New York City, for example, bans people from keeping ferrets, snapping turtles, pythons, and scorpions as pets. It seems unlikely that a family would have a polar bear named Fluffy or a whale named Bubbles as a pet, New York City has specific laws banning these wild animals from residences. These laws exist for a good reason. In 2003, a man in a Manhattan apartment  was discovered to have a 350-pound Bengal tiger as a pet.",

A funeral parlor is a place where the preparation of the corpse for burial takes place. Part of the preparation can be dressing the deceased, doing their makeup, and placing them in a coffin for people to see. Some people do have a closed casket wake, where you can't see the dead person; some people are not even choosing coffins for their dearly departed loved ones.\nIn the United States, more and more families are choosing not to have traditional wakes. There is a recent trend of people having non-traditional wakes with the deceased person posed doing something they loved doing when they were alive. For example, a family in New Orleans had their dead loved one posed at a table with a cigarette between her fingers and a can of beer. One funeral home in Puerto Rico has become famous for its non-traditional wakes. It all started in 2008, when a family asked for their dead loved one to be propped up against the wall of their home for the wake. When a paramedic died, his family had his dead body in the driver's seat of an ambulance. Another family had a man propped up in a fake boxing ring for his wake. One dead man was posed on top of his motorcycle. Recently, a grandmother was posed sitting in her rocking chair.\nThese non-traditional wakes have their critics though. Some people think they are disrespectful. They think of death as a solemn and sad occasion, not a time to pose the dead as if they were toys. Fans feel it helps them remember the dead as they were when they were alive.",

Back in that time, California was known for offering many job opportunities in farming, and many young men were hopping on trains from all over the country to arrive in Los Angeles. Unfortunately, many of those men often ended up finding themselves without a job, a place to stay, or even food to eat. To help these people, many churches began to establish shelters in the area of Los Angeles that would eventually become Downtown. Even as the farm landscape changed to a big city environment, these shelters remained a refuge for many individuals that found themselves homeless\nNowadays, the homeless population of Los Angeles is made up of much more than just young men looking for work. Many economic and social changes have resulted in both men and women of all ages turning to the streets of Los Angeles. Some of them are there as a result of substance abuse that has left them moneyless and jobless. Others are veterans from various wars that cannot find the resources to get back to their normal lives. Additionally, many of these people suffer from mental disabilities that limit them from finding a job or being accepted in the rest of society.\nSince there are a lot of different causes that lead to homelessness, it is easy to see why finding solutions to helping all of the homeless people is so difficult. Although there are many programs that focus on providing the homeless food daily, it is much harder to find programs that try to assist the homeless in finding jobs, and stable housing. In order to finally find a solution that will effectively help decrease the number of homeless people in the city, a lot more individualized attention must be placed on individuals based on their physical and mental health, and circumstance.",

A paramedic must be in fit condition, and be mentally strong to perform his or her duties in the face of danger. Many of these heroes must endure life-threatening situations when responding to emergencies. Paramedics are usually attached to a county, or city fire department, but there are also some private paramedic organizations.\nIn Southern California, there are two primary schools for paramedic training. They are UCLA's Daniel Freeman Paramedic program and the Paramedic Training Institute. Both of these schools provide candidates for the Los Angeles County and City Fire Departments. To become a paramedic for a county or city organization, candidates must also pass a psychological screening and a physical training program.\nSome of the equipment paramedics carry is very specialized. They carry basic and advanced life support gear such as forcible entry tools so they can reach people in peril, saws to cut through obstacles, and other emergency equipment. Paramedics provide a valuable service to the communities they serve. They must be certified in Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) techniques, and be trained to handle all situations.\nSome paramedics are trained to respond to what is called Mass Casualty Incidents (MCI). These emergencies occur whenever there is a tragic event such as the September 11, 2001 attacks on the country, and other emergencies like earthquakes, mudslides, or floods. Paramedics  can also be sent to emergency situations by citizens who call the 911 emergency phone number.",

It was the most tragic day in the history of the country since December 7, 1941 when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. September 11th was the day Muslim extremists hijacked four commercial airliners in an attempt to destroy the American spirit by slamming those jets into four buildings. Three of the four jets reached their targets, while one was stopped by a group of everyday heroes who gave their lives for their country.\nIn the early morning hours on September 11, 2001, American Airlines Flight 11 slammed into the north tower of the World Trade Center in New York City. A few minutes later, Flight 175, also an American Airlines flight, struck the south tower. Both suicide attacks brought the towers down, but not immediately. It took time for the extreme heat from the burning jet fuel to weaken the towers to their eventual collapse. At about the same time, American Airlines, Flight 77 crashed into the Pentagon, which is a government building in the country's capitol, Washington D.C.\nThe fourth flight, United Airlines Flight 93, was also headed for the capitol city. Most people think its target was either the capitol building, or the White House, the president's home. A group of brave passengers, upon hearing the news of what was happening in the country, decided to take down the giant airplane even though they knew they would not survive. They stormed the cockpit and took the controls from the hijackers. The plane flew out of control, crashing into a field in the state of Pennsylvania, where all passengers were killed.\nIn all, about 3,000 Americans lost their lives on that day, but the American spirit was not suppressed. Those responsible for the attacks were quickly dealt with, and the country soon began its journey to recovery. September 11, 2001, a day America will never forget.",

Both of these police forces are some of the largest in the country. They handle a full-range of police duties ranging from traffic citations to murder, rape, and robbery cases. There are also a number of smaller police agencies operating side by side with the LAPD and L.A. County Sheriff's Department. Cities, such as Monterey Park, have their own police force, while smaller cities depend on the Sheriff's Department for their law enforcement needs. Because of the unique nature of the state, California created the California Highway Patrol.\nThe CHP, as it is usually called, is a police agency that is entrusted with patrolling the vast number of freeway miles that exist in California. The state was built during a time of great mobility after the advent of the personal vehicle. Because of this, the state has more freeway miles than any other states in the United States with the exception of Texas. However, California has the most licensed drivers, and by far, the most registered vehicles. This made it necessary to create a police force dedicated to its highways.\nCHP officers are endowed with the same powers other police officers have. However, they do not have a crime investigation team for any offense other than traffic-related crimes. Whenever the CHP first responds to a crime that is not traffic-related, its officers perform the same duties a regular officer does. It then turns investigations over to the LAPD, or Sheriff's office depending on the location of the crime. The CHP has a long, and storied history. Many young Californians, both male and female, are attracted to the CHP, and enroll into its academy in Sacramento, the state's capital.",

The region with its bay has one of the most breathtaking views in the world, and part of which is the historic Golden Gate Bridge.\nIt is perhaps the most iconic and recognizable landmark in the entire United States. Construction on the bridge began in 1933, while the country was deeply mired in the Great Depression. Many people think the bridge was, in large part, responsible for the country's economic recovery because of the number of workers employed. The material used to build the bridge also contributed to the manufacturing, distribution, and transportation.\nThe bridge connects San Francisco to the San Francisco peninsula in Marin County through both California State Route 1, and U.S. Route 101. Before the bridge was built, the only way to get from one location to the other was to go around the bay, or to take a ferry across. Construction of the bridge was controversial at the time. Many thought the project was simply too complex, expensive, and dangerous to build. The construction plan approved concentrated on safety for the workers who would be involved in the construction, and it worked well until February 17, 1937. Remarkably, only one worker had died up to that date, but on that date, a scaffolding collapsed killing 10 men in the tragic accident.\nThe bridge was completed later that year, and has been in use ever since.

In all, there are three lines currently operating in the city, and boasts a fleet of 12 cable cars. There used to be 23 lines in use throughout the city connecting the diverse communities that make up San Francisco. The open-air cars are a major tourist attraction, and are still used by San Francisco commuters on a daily basis.\nThe simple reason cable cars were first used in the city was because of its landscape. San Francisco is very hilly, which makes it impossible for municipal buses to scale. The solution for this problem was the cable car. These cars are literally pulled by cable, up and down the steep hills of the city, making it easier for people to get from one end of the city to the other.\nThere are two types of cars in use today. Single-ended cars and double-ended cars. The single-ended cars have open-sided sections with seats that face outward to the street. The rear section of these cars is enclosed with seats facing the interior of the car. These cars seat 29 passengers. They travel in both directions by using a swivel-based turntable that turns the car at the end of the line. The double-ended cars are a bit larger, and can hold up to 68 passengers. It has 34 seats, and grips for an additional 34 standing passengers. The best feature of these cars is the pure fun they are to ride.

Its population is under 2,000,000, making it the 30th largest city in the country. Its original population in 1905 was only 5,000. Much of the city's growth is due to the gambling industry. Many states have since legalized gambling, including New Jersey, and California, but Las Vegas remains the No. 1 tourist city for gamblers in the U.S. Today some of its largest and most beautiful hotels include Bellagio, Flamingo, Caesars Palace, Treasure Island, Mandalay Bay, and Wynn. These hotels are on Las Vegas Boulevard, which is commonly called \"The Strip.\" With its nearly year-round sunshine, beautiful casinos, and variety of gaming options, Las Vegas remains the best location for gambling in the U.S.",

Public TV differs from the more common commercial television in that it is not funded by advertising revenue. Public Television is a network of television stations throughout the country that is dedicated to bringing alternative programming to the people of the United States.\nMr. Rogers' Neighborhood ran from February 1968 through August 2001, and was hosted by the show's namesake, Fred Rogers. It was a half-hour children's show that featured the popular Rogers as host. It is often referred to as the Mr. Rogers show.\nRogers began his show in 1953 on a PBS station in the northeast part of the country as the Children's Corner. He performed as a puppeteer, and it was aired on live television. There Rogers developed many of the characters that would become famous as his show progressed. In 1967, his show went on the national TV stage, and remained there until 2001.\nRogers' style and calm demeanor made him an instant celebrity who was well-liked by both children and adults. In his early life, Rogers studied to become a Presbyterian minister, but didn't like how children's programming was being presented. He began writing children's songs, and soon began his own local show on public television. During the next three decades, Rogers became a true American icon through his show. His great compassion, morality, and patience were possibly his most liked characteristics.\nRogers was not only a great TV personality, he was also a human rights advocate. He received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, as well as the Peabody Award for meritorious public service. Rogers was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame, and has received approximately 40 honorary degrees.",

Before 1776, much of the southern and western states, such as Texas, New Mexico, Colorado, Nevada, Arizona, and California were part of Mexico. Following the war between the U.S. and Mexico in the 1800s, these states became part of the United States, but there still remained a very large Mexican population.\nThe Latino population is the largest, single ethnic group in the country. It accounts for 17 percent of the nation's population, and 63 percent of those Latinos are of Mexican origins. The Cinco de Mayo is a large celebration in the country's southwest region. It celebrates the Mexican victory in the Battle of Puebla, against France on May 5, 1862. Curiously, the day is celebrated more in the United States than it is in Mexico itself.\nIn Los Angeles, the city celebrates the event with the Fiesta Broadway, which is the largest Cinco de Mayo celebration in the world. More than half a million people come to downtown L.A. to participate in the street fair that covers 24 square blocks. The celebration takes place on the last Sunday of April. There are rides, games, and especially food at this celebration and it is growing every year. Los Angeles is not the only Southland city to host Cinco de Mayo celebrations. The cities of Corona, West Los Angeles, and Commerce also have events, and the famous Olvera Street celebration in downtown L.A. is also very popular.\nOne of the most unique Cinco de Mayo events takes place in the Hancock Park district of Los Angeles. It is called the Single de Mayo. This celebration is an annual charity event that began in 1999. It is a private party that benefits the homeless by providing shelter and support. Cinco de Mayo is a truly American celebration.",

The surprise attack was intended to destroy the American Pacific Fleet that stood in the way of Japan's complete domination of the Pacific Ocean during the 1940s. The attack was coordinated with attacks in the Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, and Hong Kong. Pearl Harbor was attacked by more than 350 Japanese airplane fighters, bombers and torpedo planes that were launched from six aircraft carriers.\nThe early-morning attack sank four U.S. battleships, and four more were heavily damaged. Six of the eight battleships were restored, and returned to service, but the Japanese also destroyed, or damaged three cruisers, three destroyers, a minelayer, and an anti-aircraft training ship. In addition, 188 U.S. aircraft were destroyed, with many of them on the ground. The attack was devastating. It took the U.S. years to recover from all the damage caused on that fateful morning. However, the Japanese were unable to destroy their main targets, the Navy's aircraft carriers. By what some call a stroke of luck, the U.S. carrier fleet was out to sea at the time of the attack.\nThe country was in shock at the news of the disaster. U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt called the attack cowardly, and declared December 7th as \"A day that will live in infamy.\" On December 8, the United States formally declared war on Japan. This plummeted the country into World War II, which Roosevelt had long hoped to avoid. Soon after the United States' declaration of war against Japan, Germany, which was a Japanese ally, declared war on the U.S. and the country was now fully involved in the greatest war in the history of the world.",

It is truly a melting pot of diversity. All these cultures have come together to create a new culture - an American culture. Many of the traditions, customs, religions, and celebrations of these cultures have been adopted into American culture, including funeral traditions.\nTraditional American funerals are basic. They usually include some sort of religious ritual, followed by a procession to the burial grounds, and a small ceremony at the grave site, but these vary depending on the culture. At most American funerals, the deceased person's family sends out a death announcement called an obituary. These obits normally serve to pass information to others about the deceased, and the time and day of the funeral event. At the church service, the deceased is usually eulogized by friends and family. This is where a person goes up to the front of the crowd to say a few things about the deceased, and how he or she affected their life. The procession usually takes the form of a caravan of private cars, and trucks that follow the hearse, which contains the deceased's coffin, and remains.\nAt the gravesite, another small ritual takes place where the deceased is given a blessing from a member of the clergy. Friends and family are then allowed to say goodbye to the deceased. There is an American tradition of picking up a handful of soil, and tossing it on the coffin as a way of saying farewell to the deceased. The family then gathers at a home, or restaurant with some of the attendees to have a meal, and to exchange stories before going on their way. Most cultures in the U.S. have adopted this traditional American funeral ritual, but many include features that are unique to their individual culture.",

That is the day President John Fitzgerald Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas while riding in an open-air car. The president was visiting Texas for the first time since his inauguration in January, 1961. Kennedy was one of the most popular presidents in the history of the United States, and still remains so today. His death shocked the nation for several reasons, but mostly because it was televised on a live broadcast. Kennedy was the first president to appear on television at a time when most Americans owned a TV. He was not the first president to be televised, but previous presidents who appeared on TV did not reach the general public because before 1960, not many Americans owned a set.\nKennedy was warned not to ride in an open-air car that day by his bodyguards, but he wanted the public to see him live. He did not want to be hidden behind an armored car. According to the official government commission, Kennedy fell victim to a single assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald, but many Americans dispute that finding to this date. Police say Oswald shot the president from a building while Kennedy rode in his car with his wife. The mood was festive at the time as the city of Dallas welcomed the president to Texas. Kennedy was a handsome, young president who was the youngest man ever to reach the presidency.\nOswald later killed a Dallas police officer during his escape from the crime scene, but was soon found hiding in a movie theater. He required police protection from an outraged public, and was held in protective custody. Oswald, who was a former member of the U.S. military, was unhappy with the president for his policies, but never admitted to being the assassin. Conspiracy theories involving rival political parties, the Cuban government, and organized crime have also been advanced as to who actually killed Kennedy.",

Some people also think there is another class in between poor and middle class called working class. United States culture is based on the idea that people can move up the economic ladder and become middle class or even rich if they were born poor. This is the idea of going from \"rags to riches\". Moving up the class ladder is not easy though. Higher education needed to get a good paying job is expensive.\nClass in the United States is more than just how much money a person makes though. Education, what job a person has, where they live, and the culture, all play a role in what class a person will be classified as. For example, a person with only a high school diploma and a low-paying service job may be considered poor or low class. While a person with a Ph.D., who owns their own company, would be considered high class or wealthy.  In a way this makes sense because high-paying jobs usually require a high-level education. But for some people, class is something you are born with. For example, the children of billionaire Donald Trump were born rich and upper class without having done anything to earn that status.\nGender plays a role too in how someone can move up the economic ladder. Women earn less than men do, so it is harder for them to accumulate wealth. Race also plays a role in how much people earn and their ability to move up the economic ladder. In the United States, most families require both the man and woman to work in order to support the household.",

Parks became famous for challenging a discriminatory policy in the city of Montgomery, Alabama. During the 1950s, Black Americans in the south were not allowed to ride in the front seats of public buses if a white person needed that seat. Blacks were expected to get out of their seats, and go to the back of the bus, which was designated as \"Colored Only.\"\nOn December 1, 1955, Parks refused to obey the bus drivers order to surrender her seat to a white passenger who had boarded the bus. Even though Parks was seated in the Colored Only section, the bus was filled, and she was required by law to give her seat to the white rider. Parks was arrested, and charged with civil disobedience. She later said  she had grown \"tired of giving in.\"\nHer arrest and subsequent trial made Parks a national symbol for the Civil Rights Movement. Her arrest also lead to the Montgomery Bus Boycott that was a political and social protest campaign against racial segregation. Although the boycott only lasted 21 days, it was instrumental in the Supreme Court decision to declare Alabama's practice of segregation unconstitutional.\nParks has remained a symbol for the Civil Rights Movement even after her death in 2005 at the age of 92. She has been called the \"First Lady of Civil Rights,\" by the United States Congress, and \"The Mother of the Freedom Movement.\" She has been honored by the U.S. government with prestigious awards such as the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and Congressional Gold Medal.

Chicago is the home of other famous firsts. It was the birthplace of the refrigerated rail car, mail-order catalogs, the car radio, the TV remote control, the first Ferris wheel, the first steel rail road, the first planetarium in the Western Hemisphere. Chicago is also the home to the first blood bank and the first drive-in bank. It is also the home to The Lincoln Park Zoo, the oldest public zoo in the U.S. Maybe the windy city should be called the city of firsts.\nChicago is the third most populous city in the U.S., after New York City and Los Angeles.

It is a very old city, founded in 1630 by English colonists fleeing religious persecution. The American Revolution, when colonists, known as patriots, fought for their independence from the British, began in Boston with the Battle of Lexington. Other key events in the revolution occurred in the city. One was the Boston Massacre, when British troops fired upon protesters, killing five. The Boston Tea Party, when colonists dumped an entire shipment of British tea into the harbor to protest taxes, was not a party at all. Paul Revere's \"midnight ride\", where he warned colonists of British troops approaching, also happened in Boston. Many of these sites can be accessed by taking a walk down the \"Freedom Trail\", a red line of bricks embedded in the ground through the city.\nBoston is also a city of notable firsts. America's first public school was founded in Boston in 1635. Boston Common, where British troops camped during the American Revolution and where early colonists hanged people, is the oldest public park in the United States. Boston is also home to the oldest subway system in the United States.\nLike many cities in the United States, immigrants played a large role in its development. Irish immigrants who settled in Boston, for example, played a large role in both local and national politics. Boston also has a large and active Puerto Rican community and Italian community.

People felt taxes were unfair because there was no colonial representation in the British parliament. One tax was the stamp tax, which taxed printed materials such as newspapers. The colonists called this \"taxation without representation\". Colonists who wanted freedom from English rule were known as Patriots. Those who supported British rule were known as Loyalists. Before full scale war broke out, there were many acts of protest by patriots, like the Boston Tea Party when Bostonians boarded British ships and dumped 342 chests of tea into the harbor because of a tea tax. On April 19 the first shots were fired in Lexington and Concord, Massachusetts, which officially started the war.\nMany people were involved in the struggle for independence. Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and John Adams worked together to write the Declaration of Independence. On July 4, 1776, patriots declared themselves free. Most people know George Washington was the first president of the United States. Before that he was the commander-in-chief of the patriot army. Most of the battles in the American Revolution were fought in the northeast in places near Boston, and New York.\nThe British, known as redcoats because of their red uniform jackets, had help from German mercenary soldiers called Hessians. Patriots had support from other Europeans. France entered the American Revolution on the side of the colonists in 1778. This helped force the British surrender at Yorktown, Virginia, in 1779. However, fighting would not formally end until 1783 with the Treaty of Paris when Great Britain recognized the United States as an independent nation.",

The main cause was Southern states feeling that the U.S. federal government in Washington D.C. should not have the power to tell them what to do. This was especially true about two issues, taxes and slavery. The Southern economy was based on agriculture while the Northern economy was based on manufacturing. Southern crops  like cotton were sold to factories and then Southerners had to pay taxes on the finished goods sold back to them like clothing. Many Southerners felt this was unfair. Additionally the agricultural economy in the south was reliant on the labor of enslaved Africans and their descendants. Many people, especially from the North, felt this was wrong and that slavery needed to be abolished. Southerners felt the abolitionists were threatening their way of life. Seven Southern slave states, banded together, declared their secession and formed the Confederate States of America. The government in Washington D.C. and its army was known as the Union, since they were fighting to keep the country united.\nAbraham Lincoln was president of the United States during the Civil War. The President of the Confederate States was Jefferson Davis. The first battle was the Battle of Fort Sumter. During the war President Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which declared the freedom of slaves in the Confederate States of America. This action was supposed to show that Lincoln was still in charge of the entire United States.\nThe Civil War was the bloodiest war fought inside the United States. 620,000 were killed and millions more were injured. One of the bloodiest battles of the Civil War was the Battle of Gettysburg in Pennsylvania. 51,000 people from both sides died, more than in any other battle.

The fire lasted for three days. 100,000 people were left homeless, and at least 300 were killed. What was amazing was how quickly the city was rebuilt, eventually becoming the third most populous city in the United States.\nThe Great Boston Fire of 1872 created a property damage of $73.5 million,  more than any other fire in the U.S. history. Most of Downtown Boston and the financial district burned down in the fire that began in a warehouse basement. 30 people died, and thousands lost their jobs and their homes. However, the city was rebuilt in two years.

Child labor was not uncommon. The youngest victims were two 14-year-old girls who worked  in the factory. So many people died because the owners of the factory locked the doors to the stairs and exits. This was to prevent the workers from taking breaks and stealing. As a result of the fire and huge loss of life, many people began protesting poor working conditions. The U.S. Congress passed laws improving factory safety conditions.

The Salem Witch Trials accused more than 200 people of being witches. People believed witchcraft was real and was criminal. Among the accused were women, men, and even children. Nineteen people were sentenced to death. They were all hanged. One of the accused was tortured with heavy rocks being placed on him until he was crushed underneath the weight.

There is one legend that says the city got its name because of the large number of unemployed selling apples on the streets of New York City during the Great Depression.\nThe term more likely has its roots in horse racing from the 1920's. Prizes were called \"apples\" and a newspaper reporter when writing about races often would call the big prize the big apple. In fact, the \"big apple\" soon was used to mean any big city. In the late 1920s through the 1940s, \"The Big Apple\" was not just a nickname for New York, it was also the name of a song, a dance, and a place to dance and sing.

Yet, in the middle of Manhattan Island is the most visited park in the United States, with 35 million visitors a year. Central Park, a National Historical Landmark, takes up 843 acres of land. It is a green space where people go to escape the noise and crowds of urban life. Before it opened in 1857, it wasn't an empty space. People lived on that land. They were mostly poor free blacks, Irish, and Italian immigrants. They were forced off the land to construct the park.\nOne section of the park is called Sheep Meadow. Now it's just a grassy area where people can lie in the sun, but actual sheep used to graze there from 1864 to 1934. The sheep from there were eventually moved to another park in the city. Many events take place in Central Park, especially in the warm spring and summer months. There is an outdoor theater, where Shakespeare's plays are performed. The plays are free, which causes such high demand that people line up for hours before performances to get inside. There are also free music concerts. Every summer a stage is set up. These Summer Stage concerts feature musicians from all over the world. Both the New York Philharmonic Orchestra and the Metropolitan Opera also host free performances in the park in the spring and summer. There are also two small zoos inside the park, and a number of small lakes in the park. One of the lakes rents out small mechanical sailboats. There is also a puppet theater and a carousel for kids.\nThe park is not dead in the winter. When it snows, families often go to sled or to go ice-skating in an outdoor rink owned by Donald Trump.",

His ads ran on television from 1964 through 1999, effectively entering the collective conscience of the American people for generations. Philip Morris is one of the largest tobacco producing companies in the world, and the corporation used the Marlboro Man with great success over the years.\nThe Marlboro Man was a strong, rugged-looking man who rode a mighty horse, and traveled throughout the country promoting tobacco products. He appeared in television, radio, print, and billboard ads for decades. When the United States Surgeon General deemed tobacco smoke as unhealthy in the 1960s, the beginning of the end for the Marlboro Man had begun. The Surgeon General began an anti-smoking campaign by requiring all cigarette companies to place its warning label on each package sold in the country. The warning included the wording that \"Tobacco smoke can cause lung cancer.\" Soon the pressure was on the tobacco companies to curb their advertising campaigns.\nIn 1955, tobacco sales reached $15 billion in the United States alone. After the Marlboro Man was introduced to the American public, that total reached $20 billion. This increase was largely based on the Marlboro Man campaign. The company also started an advertising scheme by offering genuine Marlboro Man gear for sale. These commodities were of high quality that appealed to the outdoor type of person. The gear ranged from camping equipment, hats, to outdoor clothing. It was very successful in its time. This success came at a great expense though. Four men who portrayed the Marlboro Man died of lung cancer, earning Marlboro cigarettes as the cowboy killer. The Marlboro Man is still popular in some parts of Europe and Japan, where smoking is still in vogue.",

The group's first appearance was seen by more than 73 million viewers in February, 1964, introducing the band to the American people. In the months to follow, the group became the biggest Rock 'N' Roll band ever to hit the United States.\nThe group's success opened the door for other British bands to make their way to America. Bands such as the Rolling Stones, The Who, The Kinks and The Dave Clark Five were soon playing their music to American audiences.\nThe Beatles were made up by four of the finest musicians to ever play rock music. Their lead singer was Paul McCartney, and drummer Ringo Starr. Both still play to this day. Two of the original members, singers and songwriters, John Lennon, and George Harrison, have tragically passed away, but their music lives in American culture to this day. The Beatles have sold more records in the United States than any other country in the world.\nThere was controversy in the U.S. prior to the group's first appearance. Conservative Americans viewed the Beatles as upstarts, with brash, new ideas, lyrics, and sound. The young generation of the time was ready for a change, and the Beatles gave them what they wanted. They were nicknamed the \"Mop Tops\" because of their long, bowl-like haircuts that flew in the face of convention in the 60s. Nothing was going to stop the Beatles though. Their music is as popular today as it was 50 plus years ago. This February, the Grammy Awards presented a special telecast celebrating the 50th anniversary of the group's first appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show.",

It features several astronomical displays and telescopes in the Hollywood Hills in the Los Feliz district of the city. The Observatory was built on land donated by Griffith J. Griffith in 1896. Griffith was a Welsh-born philanthropist and mining tycoon, who wanted to give the public access to a state-of-the-art observatory, so it was free of charge to visitors. He felt common people should be able to enjoy the wonders of the universe, and not be solely for the scientific community.\nGriffith donated 3,015 acres of land specifically to house the observatory that opened on May 14, 1935. During the first five days after the opening, the planetarium averaged more than 13,000 visitors a day. One of the major attractions was the Foucault Pendulum that is designed to show the earth's rotation and the Zeiss reflecting telescope. The observatory has a striking view of Los Angeles and Hollywood, and the Pacific Ocean can be seen on clear days from there.\nIn 2002 the planetarium was subjected to a $93 million renovation and expansion, which closed the museum for four years. After it reopened in 2006, the facility expanded underground with new exhibits, a cafe, a gift shop, and a theater. The Wilder Hall of the Eye section concentrates on the astronomical aspect of the observatory. It is where people can view the stars through the observatory's telescope, and features an interactive exhibit that is very popular. The Ahmanson Hall of the Sky is another popular attraction for viewing images in the night sky that are visible to the naked eye. The observatory frequently stages viewing nights when the public is invited to bring their own telescopes. It is open daily, and remains free of charge.",

The third most common religion in the U.S. is Islam. Other religions practiced in the U.S include Hinduism, and Buddhism. About 20 percent of all people in the U.S. say they don't practice any religion. One of the founding principles of the United States is religious freedom, which means people can practice whatever religion they want without being discriminated against. This is even guaranteed in the U.S. Constitution. This is one reason why the United States has no official religion.\nBecause there are so many different religions in the United States, there are many different types of houses of worship. Christians attend churches. Jews and Hindus attend temples. Muslims attend mosques. Many people use what they wear to reflect their religious beliefs. For example, some Islamic women wear a scarf called \"hijab\" to cover their head. It is disrespectful to ask a Muslim woman to take off her hijab or ask for her to show you what is under it. Male followers of an Indian religion called \"Sikhism\" usually wear cotton turbans. Again it is wrong to take a person's turban off or ask that they take it off. Male followers of Hasidism, a branch of Judaism, have long curls on the side of their heads. They wear a fringed prayer shawl. Other Jewish men may wear a small cap on their heads called a yarmulke.

Many of the events that took place during those controversial 10 years profoundly affect modern American society today. The war in Vietnam was raging in the 60s, and the popular president, John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963. These are just two of the events that defined the decade. There were many more historic events during that era that deeply divided the country. Woodstock was designed to show how the young generation can coexist with the older generation of Americans by living in harmony with one another.\nAlthough the event did not occur in the town of Woodstock, New York, the city has become synonymous with the celebration. More than 400,000 young people gathered at the dairy farm in the small town of White Lake, New York to witness music history in the making. Rolling Stone Magazine listed the event as one of \"the 50 Moments that Changed the History of Rock 'n' Roll.\" Some of the biggest names in rock history performed at the three-day event, including The Who, the Grateful Dead, Janis Joplin, Jefferson Airplane, and Jimi Hendrix. In all, 32 acts performed at the outdoor festival, and it was free of charge to all.\nTwo soundtracks were released in the following two years. Both albums featured the live performances with introductions. The documentary film \"Woodstock\" was released in 1970, and received an Oscar in the Academy Award for Feature Documentary category.

It consists of the Veterans Health Administration, the Veterans Benefits Administration, and the National Cemetery Administration. The VA Health Administration is responsible for providing veterans with all health care issues, while the Benefits Administration is designed to help veterans in areas such as guaranteed home loans, insurance vocational rehabilitation and educational benefits. The National Cemetery Administration provides burial and memorial benefits, and is entrusted with the maintenance of the VA's cemeteries.\nThe VA has served U.S. veterans from several wars beginning with survivors of World War I. It has continued the tradition of serving former military members by providing services for those veterans who need help readjusting to civilian life. Many of these veterans, especially those who saw combat during their time in the military, are in need of basic medical services for wounds suffered in conflicts. This was the original concept for the creation of the VA.\nSince that time, the VA has expanded greatly, and now provides additional services such as educational benefits, and home-buying assistance. It also helps those veterans who had become homeless after their service to their country ended. There are approximately 30 million military veterans living in the U.S. today.

The show aired on the FOX Channel for 11 years, and many believe it was responsible for keeping the news station alive during the early years.\nIn 1987, commercial TV in the United States was dominated by the big three: the American Broadcasting Company (ABC), the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), and the Columbia Broadcasting Company (CBS). When the FOX Channel appeared on the scene, few people gave it much chance to survive in the face of its stiff competition, but Married with Children changed all that.\nThe show followed the exploits of a dysfunctional family that lived in a fictional suburb of Chicago. The main character was the father, Al Bundy, who was a lovable loser living with his self-centered wife, and bratty kids. Together, the family makes Al's life miserable as he stumbles, and fumbles his way through life. Al works as a shoe salesman that pays very little, and has little chance of promotion.\nAl is an endearing character who gained the adoration of the American public for many years. The actor Ed O'Neil, who played Al, said that people still approach him to this day calling him Al, or Mr. Bundy. O'Neil also said that playing the character for so many years made it difficult for him to find work once the series ended because people associated him with Al.\nOne of the things that made the show so popular is that no subject was off-limits to the writers. It was a controversial show  that dealt with controversial subjects. Many people boycotted the show because of its racy content, but FOX continued on. The show has cultivated a cult-like following that began in the 80s, and continues today.",

In the times before the invention of the personal computer, and the advent of the World Wide Web, social networking was done in person. People who had similar likes and interests  would gather together to share experiences, make new contacts, and promote themselves, or their businesses.\nOn the Internet, social networking websites made their first appearances during the late 1990s. The first major social networking website in the United States was MySpace. MySpace was a comprehensive, social networking site that allowed its users to exchange messages, share pictures, and make new friends in a way that was never thought of in the past. With MySpace, people who did not go out much could reach out to others from the comfort of their own homes.\nIn 2004, Facebook was created. It was originally a website created for use by Harvard University students, graduates, and faculty, but it soon expanded to include just about everyone. Facebook is an elaborate social networking site that has grown incredibly fast. It is now larger than some of the largest companies in the world. It is a website that is in constant change. New features are added regularly. Facebook has revolutionized the way people stay connected with each other and the rest of the world. The way it works is simple. Users can set up a new account easily. All a new user needs is an email address to start. Once a person has created an account, he, or she can invite friends by sending a request out to people they know who also have their own Facebook pages.

No matter what kind of party you are going to, it's a good idea to make sure you are actually invited. It's considered rude to just show up unless the host, the person giving the party, invited you. You will either get a paper, email or verbal invitation to a party. Alternately, you can also go as a guest of someone else invited, like as his or her date. Once invited, it is very important to let the host know if you are actually going to show up. Many times hosts have a party catered, which means other people prepare the food. They need to know how much food to have. Letting them know if you are  showing up or not helps the host and is considered polite.\nIt's also important to be relatively punctual for a party. Most parties in the U.S. never start exactly when they say they will. Many people like to be \"fashionably late\", that is, showing up about 30 minutes after the party is supposed to start. People like to do this to make a big entrance. Showing up more than 30 minutes before or after is considered rude though. If you show up too early, you are likely to interrupt valuable preparation time of the host. If you show up too late, you are just being rude.\nEven if it is not a birthday party, it is polite to bring a gift for the host. It doesn't need to be a fancy gift.

A bride may want a blender, but she sure doesn't want to receive three and have to deal with the hassle of returning extras. Most bridal shower gifts are items that a newly married couple needs to start their life together. These gifts include dishes, pots, pans, and even appliances like toasters and microwave ovens.  Many brides also look forward to receiving some money. Cash or checks are considered appropriate gifts for a bridal shower. The money comes in handy to help pay for an expensive wedding. Sometimes people bring tasteless gifts like lingerie to bridal showers. Some people think those gifts are good because they help the new couple \"spice up\" their married life. Others find these types of presents embarrassing.\nWhile many bridal showers are surprises, others are planned with input from the bride-to-be. A bridal shower can be small and intimate and held in someone's home. It can also be a larger affair held at a restaurant or a catering hall.

Sometimes co-workers of a pregnant person will also throw a baby shower.\nThe baby shower is usually given when the mother-to-be is between 6 and 9 months pregnant.

A baby shower can be held in someone's home or outside, like in a restaurant or catering hall. Traditionally only women are invited to a baby shower.

This list usually consists of things the mother wants for her baby including clothes, diapers and even furniture like high chairs and cribs. This way friends and family members can go to the store and buy something from the list. Registering helps make sure that there aren't repeat items, like 30 bottles when a new mom only needed 15.\nSome baby showers also feature a paper mache wishing well. This is not just for decoration.

The actions of helicopter parents actually hurt children, by not teaching them to be responsible for their actions. For example, a helicopter parents would call their adult college-age child to wake them up to go to class when part of college is learning to be responsible and learning to manage your own time. Helicopter parents are also overly worried about their kids getting hurt. This means helicopter parents hold back their child's natural curiosity. Part of growing up  means your kid has to get hurt, physically and emotionally. This is how lessons are learned.

The name free-range comes from the idea that kids should have the freedom to explore their world or range in a way that makes sense to them. This often means that free-range moms will not schedule activities like extra classes or play dates for their kids. Instead a free-range mom will just let her child play in a park. There is less of an emphasis on things like the latest toys.",

        "title": "Attachment Parenting",
        "content": "Having your kid physically attached to you probably doesn't sound like fun, but an American pediatrician, William Sears, promotes a style of parenting that keeps small children as physically attached as possible. This is called attachment parenting.\nThe idea behind attachment parenting is that if a small baby feels protected and safe by physical contact with their parent, especially their mother, that child will grow up to be a more independent adult. One way parents are encouraged to be close to their babies is by using a sling or a wrap to carry the baby around instead of putting the baby in a carriage. This is often called \"wearing\" your baby. Parents are also encouraged to sleep with their babies. Parents are too big to fit in a crib, so instead parents are told to bring the baby into the adult bed. This is supposed to teach the baby about sleep regulation as well since the baby will learn to mimic adult sleep patterns. This co-sleeping is controversial though. There are concerns that babies sleeping with adults could suffocate, accidentally get crushed, or fall off the bed. There is also concern about sudden infant death syndrome, or SIDS, where babies just suddenly stop breathing.\nAnother marker of attachment parenting is not worrying about spoiling a baby. Many times parents feel that paying attention to a baby's every cry makes them too needy or spoiled. Attachment parenting feels that every baby's cry should be responded to and that the baby should never be left to \"cry it out.\" Instead, the baby should be comforted and crying should be taken as a signal that the baby needs something. Most attachment parents also breastfeed on demand, feeling that not only is this physically healthier, but also promotes a bond between mother and child.",

Sometimes it seems like the birthday parties are about showing off and entertaining the parents of kids in addition to children.\nMost children's birthday parties are held in the home of the birthday boy or girl. It used to be that children's parties were just for children. Parents would drop their kids off and come back when the party was over to bring them home. Now it is more common for the parents of guests to stay for the party as well. This gives the adults time and space to socialize while the kids play games. Kids and adults don't always have the same tastes in food. So when adults are invited to stay for a child's birthday party, there is usually fancier food for the adults like cheese, crackers, and fruit platters. Meanwhile the kids eat hot dogs and potato chips. While the children drink punch, juice, or soda, the parents may be sipping cocktails, beer, or wine.\nEntertainment for a party of mixed adults and children also goes beyond the usual clown or magician. Sometimes there will be a DJ, and the adults  will dance. Party games are not just for the kids, either. While the children play traditional games like pin the tail on the donkey, the adults may play casino-type games like blackjack or poker.\nNot everyone likes this trend of adults and children partying together. Some feel that the parties should be kept separate. Some people worry about adults getting drunk in front of the kids. Others worry about kids getting abused by adults they don't know. For others, it is just about allowing a kid to have their special day. There is also a concern that these mixed parties encourage a sense of competition among parents in a community.",

They can also serve in the military and go fight in wars for the country. An 18-year old can also buy cigarettes and other tobacco products, but 18-year-olds cannot buy alcoholic beverages. People in the U.S. need to wait until they are 21 to be able to do that.\nAt the age of 18, people can legally live on their own, work, and get married. However, turning 18 doesn't mean everyone is ready to take on adult responsibilities. At the age of 18, most people are just graduating from high school. Many will go to college. Some young people choose to go to college far from their homes and live in dormitories. Others pick a college close to home and stay with their parents to save money. Yet others will choose to live on their own. Legally, a parent does not have to provide for their child when the child turns 18.\nSome parents in the U.S. take this very seriously and expect their children to move out as soon as they turn 18. Some parents will even forcibly kick their kids out when the kids turn 18. There tends to be some difference about this depending on if the kid is female or male. It is considered more acceptable for a female to stay living with her parents after her 18th birthday. Many females aren't expected to leave their parents' house until they get married. There is still an expectation for young men, however, to go out and live independent lives as soon as they can. With the economy of the U.S. struggling, some adult children are returning to their parents' home in their 20s and 30s. These are called boomerang kids, since like a boomerang, they return where they came from.",

Once children grow up and get married, they move out, leaving their aging parents to fend for themselves. When these aging parents can no longer take care of themselves because of age or illness, it is not uncommon for adult children in the U.S. to place their elderly parents in a nursing home.\nA nursing home is a facility that offers care for the elderly and ill 24 hours a day. As the name suggests, nursing homes has medical nurses, doctors, social workers, and therapists to help aging adults deal with the challenges of daily life. Most nursing homes also have social activities for the elderly to engage in and keep active. These activities range from games to dance classes, and movie nights. Nursing homes are supposed to provide three nutritious meals for their residents.\nNursing homes are controversial, however.

A typical American worker gets two or three weeks off out of a whole year for vacation. Most U.S. workers cannot take those two or three weeks consecutively. They usually have to be spread out throughout the year. Even when U.S. workers are on vacation, they are often expected to be in communication with their boss. This means checking in via email and mobile phone. Most U.S. businesses do not encourage their employees to take all the vacation days they are entitled to. In fact, most U.S. companies discourage it.\nOther countries, especially countries in Europe, have much more vacation time. In Germany many people have six weeks of paid vacation. At least three of these weeks can be taken consecutively. Maybe this is why Europeans and other travelers vacation in far-off exotic places.  Most American families tend to stay closer to home, rarely leaving the country.\nThe difference in the amount of vacation time is legal. Most companies in countries outside the U.S. have to give paid time off to their employees or else pay hefty fines. However, in the U.S. there is no federal law requiring employers to give workers paid vacation. In fact the U.S. is the only developed country that doesn't guarantee yearly time off to workers. There have been efforts to pass laws giving U.S. workers one week of paid vacation by law, but so far those efforts have not been successful.\nEven when U.S. workers do have time off, many are afraid to take it because they worry they may be seen as non-productive workers and lose their job.

        "content": "Having your own space is a sign of success in the United States. However, renting an apartment is not easy. There are a number of steps you need to take. First, you need to figure out how much you can pay per month.\nWhen you first move into a new place, most landlords, or property owners expect you, the tenant, to pay a security deposit. A security deposit is an amount of money you pay a landlord sort of as insurance that you won't destroy their property while you are living there. Usually the security deposit is equal to the amount of one-month rent. If when you move out, the apartment is in the same condition as when you moved in, the landlord will return your security deposit. If the apartment has any damage whatsoever, including holes in the walls because you hung up posters, the landlord can legally use that money to fix the apartment.\nOnce you know how much you can afford, you can begin looking for apartments for rent. You can look in the newspaper or online. Also walk around a neighborhood you want to live in and be on the lookout for \"For Rent\" signs.\nThere are two ways to rent an apartment. Most landlords rent out apartments on an annual basis. This means you will sign a document called a lease, which says you will stay in the property for one year and pay rent on a monthly basis. If you decide that you want to break the lease, or leave before your year is up, there are usually fines you will have to pay. Another way to rent an apartment is on a month-to-month basis. This means that you pay by month, and are not obligated to stay for more than a month at a time.",

Most landlords are not individuals anymore, but rather are companies that own a number of properties. You and the landlord will set a date to view the place you are interested in renting.\nOn that date you can see the apartment and ask questions. Some landlords will require you to fill out an application. The application will ask questions about your job, salary, and how many people are going to live with you in the apartment. The landlord wants to make sure they have responsible tenants who will pay rent on time. Some landlords will even ask for references, the names and telephone numbers of people who can verify that you have a job and are a responsible person. Most landlords will also run a credit check. A credit check is your history of paying bills on time. If your potential landlord sees that you owe a lot of money to different companies and don't pay your bills on time, they may not want you as a tenant. If you have bad credit or an unstable work history, you may be required to get a co-signer, that is another financially responsible adult to sign the lease, a rental contract, with you. This co-signer is legally responsible for paying the rent if you stop paying.\nIf you cannot afford a full apartment, another option is to rent a room in someone's home. The process to rent a room is like renting an apartment except you only have a room and usually have to share the bathroom and the kitchen. Most apartments and rooms in the U.S. are unfurnished. You are expected to bring your own furniture, including a bed, a dresser, a sofa, and anything else you need.",

A lease is usually good for a set time. Some leases are on a month-to-month basis, but most are for a period of one year or two years.\nThe lease or rental agreement lists out your responsibilities as a tenant and the landlord's responsibilities. The lease  will tell you how much the monthly rent is, when it is due, and how you can pay it. Some landlords will only take a certified check or money order, and others will accept a personal check or cash. If you pay your rent late, there is usually a late fee. The amount of the late fee is also usually in the lease. The lease will also tell you how much the security deposit is. Usually it is the amount of one month's rent. The lease will tell you if you can have pets or not. Many places do not allow pets. If you bring one in anyway, they can fine you or kick you out. If your apartment does allow pets, most likely you will have to pay an extra amount of money, called a pet deposit, to cover any damages caused by the animal. Other rules that may be included in a lease include whether you are allowed to smoke inside the property and whether you are allowed to make any changes like paint. Many landlords do not allow you to paint or even make holes in the wall to hang up pictures.\nA lease is proof that you legally live somewhere.

Also sometimes a friend who wants to crash on your couch ends up staying for a really long time, and ends up becoming another tenant.\nYou are responsible for all the utilities you use while living in a rental apartment. This means you will have to pay for the electricity and gas you use. If the landlord pays for any utilities, it will say so in the lease. Once you move in, you will have to call the electric company and the gas company so they can put accounts in your name.

It does mean though that with notice, the landlord is allowed to come into the apartment during a reasonable time, meaning not in the middle of the night when you are sleeping.

Cricket is a very popular sport in England, but it is played by mostly the upper-class members of that society, and it is unlikely that the poor immigrants from England played the game very much.

The way to ensure companies would continue doing business with their food trucks, caterers had to diversify their menu items to become more appealing to their customers. Soon catering trucks became specialized eateries offering foods ranging from tacos and burritos to hamburgers and hotdogs, and more exotic foods.\nOne of the most famous catering trucks is the Kogi truck. Los Angeles is home to hundreds of different cultures and the Kogi truck is a marriage of Mexican and Korean cuisine. People drive for miles to eat a Kogi Kimchi Quesadilla, or a famous spicy pork, or tofu taco. Kogi burritos are just as tasty and exotic.

The tar pits are located on Wilshire Blvd in the heart of the city, and offer a snapshot into life in the city of L.A. 10,000 years ago. The George C. Page museum was built around the tar pits specifically to research the ancient attraction.\nLocated in the Hancock Park district of L.A., the tar pits are a continuous flow from deep inside the earth's crust that frequently uncovers prehistoric animals that were caught in the tar. Many of these animals' remains are on exhibit at the Page Museum, and excavation of new fossils is an ongoing process. The site is registered as a National Natural Landmark by the U.S. government.\nIn 2009, the Page Museum, which is part of L.A.'s Natural History Museum, announced the discovery of 16 fossil deposits in 2006 unearthed during the construction of an underground parking garage. A saber-toothed cat, six dire wolves, a bison, horses, giant sloth, and an American lion were among the animals discovered. A nearly complete mammoth was also unearthed at that time. The artifacts are now part of the Page Museum exhibit, and museum officials are certain there are more fossils to be found under the streets of L.A.\nThe museum is a major attraction to visitors to L.A., and is a primary science attraction for schools, clubs and other organizations interested in the past. It is a piece of living history that is in a constant state of change because of new discoveries. It is a good place to spend a leisurely afternoon in the City of Angels, which is open all year round.",

The first shuttle manufactured was the Enterprise, which was named after the Star Trek, starship from the 1960s television series. The first orbiting shuttle, Columbia, was launched into space in April 1981. The last mission to space for the shuttle program was carried out by the shuttle Atlantis in July 2011. In all, six orbiters were built including the shuttle Endeavour, which can be seen today at the California Science Center in Los Angeles, California.\nMore than 20 organizations throughout the country petitioned to become home to the retired shuttle in 2012, but Los Angeles gained the prize. Transporting such a huge and complex machine was no easy task. It landed at the Los Angeles International Airport on September 12, 2012, and three weeks later began its journey through the streets of L.A. to the California Science Center in Exposition Park.\nThe orbiter encountered a few problems during its 12-mile journey, and it drew thousands of spectators to the streets to catch a glimpse of the giant spacecraft. Endeavour required a police escort through temporarily closed streets. More than 400 oak trees were cut down to clear the path for the shuttle; power lines and telephone poles had to be removed to accommodate the behemoth. Endeavour also had difficulty crossing bridges throughout the city, but in the end, the shuttle reached its final destination.\nToday, the Endeavour exhibit can be seen at the Samuel Oschin Pavilion at the California Science Center in Los Angeles. It is a piece of American history that is a must-see attraction to all visitors to the greater Los Angeles area.",

The object of the contest is to disable your competitor's vehicle before it stops yours. It is an exciting attraction that appeals to Americans of all ages.\nWhen Mark attended his first derby as a young boy, he was mesmerized by the action on the track. Demolition derbies are usually held in outlying areas where there is plenty of room to compete. Most derbies are in an arena,  but one of the attractions of the sport is that derbies can be held just about anywhere. After watching his first match, Mark told his dad, \"I'm going to be a derby driver one day, dad.\" His father just chuckled, but encouraged his son.\nMark got his chance last year when he drove his orange, 1978 Mustang in the Riverside County Fair's derby for the first time. The competition he entered featured 10 cars, and was as exciting as he thought it would be. He didn't win his first competition, but he got valuable experience, and is looking forward to next year's event. \"I don't give up easily,\" Mark told his dad.\nDemolition derbies got their start in New York in 1947 when former stock car racer Larry Mendelsohn realized that many people liked watching crashes more than racing. He began staging his derbies and they soon became popular at fairs and festivals. There are few rules involved with driving in a derby. Drivers can use any part of their cars to ram into other vehicles to disable them. The only rule is drivers cannot hit the driver side door where the driver sits. Most competitors use the rear portion of their vehicles to ram others, so as not to disable their own motors. Demolition derbies are a true American creation.",

This movement is responsible for some of California's breathtaking mountain ranges and deep valleys. California is part of a large area of land called the Ring of Fire that surrounds the Pacific Ocean. It is a hotbed of volcanic activity and earthquakes.\nCalifornia has had its share of earthquakes over the years. The most famous was the Great San Francisco earthquake of 1906. The city was completely unprepared for an earthquake of this magnitude. The quake was estimated to measure 7.8 on the Richter scale. More than 80 percent of the city was destroyed, and an estimated 3,000 people lost their lives.\nSan Francisco was again hit by a large earthquake in October 1989. The Loma Prieta quake measured 6.9 on the Richter scale, and occurred during the World Series, an annual championship series of baseball. Although the loss of life was minimal compared with other quakes, it had a profound effect on the transportation system in the city.\nSouthern California has suffered its share of quakes also. In 1971, the region was hit  in Sylmar, just north of Los Angeles; in 1994, the area was devastated in the Northridge quake.  Other smaller, but none-the-less frightening, and dangerous quakes have plagued both regions.\nBecause of these disasters, building codes have improved greatly. This has helped minimize the number of deaths suffered from these quakes. Furthermore, engineers are constantly at work to improve buildings.

Sometimes these concerts feature bands and musicians that are well known. Other times the concerts are given by up and coming artists. Regardless of whether you know  the band playing or not, these free concerts in the park are a great way to enjoy music outdoors. If you arrive at the park early with your friends, you can even have a picnic.\nMany parks also offer free outdoor screenings of movies. It's always a good idea to arrive early to get a good viewing spot. Being too close to the movie screen is no fun; your neck will hurt. Sitting too far means you'll have to squint. These outdoor movie screenings are also great for picnics.\nIf theater is more of your thing, most major cities have some Shakespeare-in-the-park programs.

Children under a certain age or below a certain height sometimes can ride for free or for a lower fare; the elderly and disabled usually ride for a discounted price.\nMost mass transit buses accept cash fares; almost all buses accept coins. However, a passenger has to have exact change because bus drivers do not make change. Some buses accept tokens that you can buy at some bus depots or train stations. Across the country, more and more buses use a fare card system. These are cards loaded by passengers with a certain amount of money; it could be a day, week, month or annual pass. They are swiped, tapped, or scanned when riding. The fare is automatically deducted. What is good about a fare card is that they can be reloaded via the Internet or by phone, so a passenger doesn't need to go to a station to add money. Fare cards also make transferring from one bus line to another easier. Many cities even allow for free transfers from one bus line to another when using a fare card.\nLight rails, subways, and trains usually have a similar system of paying your fare. However, people cannot pay to ride using cash since there is no one there to collect the fare. Most rail-based mass transit systems require a token or a fare card. Many rail systems have turnstiles that are locked until you swipe or tap your fare card. Some people do not like fare cards because they worry about where they are going being tracked.",

If people don't want to pay for a subscription for a specific newspaper or magazine, libraries also usually have copies for people to read at their local branch or to borrow and take home to read.\nWhile some people worry that paper books and periodicals are going out of fashion because of digital technology, libraries are using tech to their advantage. Most public library systems now offer electronic versions of books for patrons to download. These downloads are good for a limited time, just like when someone borrows a physical book from the library. A patron can download these e-books directly to their tablets or e-readers.\nFor those who like a more audio experience, many libraries also offer audiobooks, and mp3 music downloads. These downloads are also usually for a limited time, but just like when borrowing books, they are free.

This is not as easy as it may sound. Many young people have not found their field of interest. Some go to college simply because their parents want them to.\nA degree from an institution of higher learning will definitely increase employment opportunities for most people. However, there are numerous professions available to people that do not have a degree. To help these people find jobs, the state of California has an Employment Development Department that is dedicated to helping people find jobs. The EDD has offices located throughout the state. Many of these offices have Work Source centers, where a person can visit, and use EDD computers to find jobs, and meet with employment representatives.\nOther resources available to job seekers are employment agencies. Employment agencies work closely with companies of all sizes to help fill the needs of these companies. The agencies serve as pre-screeners for these companies, some of which may not have the resources to handle new hires. Some of these agencies seek specific people to fill specific jobs, while others help anyone who comes into the office.\nInternships are another way for people to gain employment. Interns are not paid for their work, or are paid very little. The purpose of an internship is for the company to see first-hand how a person works before hiring them. By using this method, employers gain insight into the workers' character and work ethic. Interns gain valuable experience they can use for future jobs.",

This means it is a good time to invite friends, neighbors, family, and co-workers to enjoy a summer feast.\nBarbeque grills vary greatly in type and size. Some people prefer the propane fueled grills, or a natural gas grill, while others prefer the old-fashioned charcoal briquettes. Of course, there are still grillers who like natural wood-burning grills.\nAlong with the food, grilling outdoors is a social setting. People get together to have beverages and food, and get caught up with the latest happenings. It's a great way to meet new people and to network with others while having a great time. Additionally, many people bring their children along, and they have fun playing with each other.\nThe main attraction though is the food. Grillers love experimenting with new spices and sauces to enhance the flavor of their favorite meats. Ribs and chicken are very popular menu items. People can cook just about anything on a grill, such as warming tortillas, toasting bread, grilling onions, corn, and fish. One of the best things about a backyard barbeque afternoon is the wonderful smell of grilling food that carries through the air.\nThe tradition is especially true on holidays such as the Fourth of July, and Veterans Day, but celebrants do not need an excuse to grill outdoors.

It featured a widowed father, Mr. Brady, who was left to raise three sons. Mr. Brady ends up marrying a woman who has three daughters of her own from a previous relationship. Both adults in the family end up helping to raise children that are not theirs biologically. Half of the children are stepchildren, although all the children call Mr. and Mrs. Brady\nWhen the television show first came out, it was controversial. Prior to the Brady Bunch, most television families were traditional ones, which means a man married a woman and together they raised their children. However, now blended families are seen as normal. Not only do people remarry after a spouse has died, as in the television show. People remarry after getting divorced. These remarried couples often have their own children. Increasingly, many blended families are not even legally married. More and more couples live together without getting married.\nBlended families happen because divorce and remarriage can be more complicated than what is seen on television. The Bradys, as widows, didn't have to worry about visitation rights. In some blended families, children live part of the time with one parent. Sometimes one parent sees his or her children only on weekends or during school vacations. The Brady family also didn't worry about child support payments.\nThe most common type of blended family is a mother with children from a previous relationship starts a new relationship with a man.

Many famous people have kept diaries. Many powerful people have kept diaries. Some of these people include famous writers and even presidents.\nKeeping a journal is said to have health benefits. It improves not just mental and emotional health, but also physical health. Studies show that keeping a diary, that is, writing out thoughts daily, can decrease asthma and arthritis symptoms. Writing uses your left brain, which is analytical and rational. While your left brain is busy, your right brain is free to create and feel. This removes mental blocks and allows you to use all of your brain power to better understand yourself, others, and the world around you.\nThe key to successful diary keeping is not editing, which means not stopping any thoughts from coming through. This even means allowing thoughts that disturb you to come out in your writing. It helps clarify your feelings, and is especially useful if a person is faced with a hard decision. Sometimes just writing down the pros and cons help you better understand an issue. You begin to see a problem from different angles. This is helpful if you are having a disagreement with others.",

        "content": "More and more people in the United States are becoming couch potatoes. This doesn't mean that they are turning into a root that can be cooked and eaten. The actual potato is a lot more useful than a person who sits on their sofa watching television or playing video games. One of the reasons why obesity rates are going up in the country is because more and more entertainment is available on television. Now television is not just for watching shows, people can watch movies, play video games, and even surf the Internet. Potatoes and sofas have other things in common, too. When most people are on their couches interacting with television, they are also often eating snacks like potato chips. This is why so many people in the United States are overweight.\nBeing a couch potato can have other health risks besides weight gain. Because more and more people are sitting in front of a television screen or even a computer screen, they aren't engaging in other physical activities like exercising. This is one reason why heart disease is a leading cause of death in the country. Another problem caused by this lack of exercise and increased screen time is weakness in muscles. There is an impact on people's mental and emotional health, too. Sitting inside in front of a screen usually means a person is spending less time interacting with friends and loved ones. This can lead to isolation, depression, and anxiety.\nBeing a couch potato is not just for adults. More and more kids are being targeted by television and the Internet. This is why  more and more children have weight-associated health problems. This is why the White House has programs like Let's Move, encouraging kids to engage in physical activity.",

This year, the fair runs from August 29 to Sept. 28, and will feature various attractions for the entire family. Going to a county fair is as American as apple pie. It was once a main attraction for rural Americans who lived far away from big cities. The traveling fair was a huge event at that time as it only came once a year. People would wait the entire year for the fair to come to their town, and many of them participated in it.\nThe L.A. County Fair is one of the largest fairs in the country. It features just about every kind of farm animals around. Parents can take their children to the petting zoos, where kids can pet lambs, piglets, calves, and foals. Additionally, people can bring home pets from the fair that include such exotic animals like snakes, rodents, and even tarantulas.\nOther attractions include the barnyard races that feature piglets racing around a track at breakneck speeds. There are several game booths, and a carnival that has some of the most exciting and thrilling rides in the region. This year the fair will introduce an exhibit that demonstrates how life was for early Californians, and a wilderness show. The wilderness show focuses on appreciating the natural beauty of the state, and how people today can preserve its beauty for future generations. The fair also stages several concerts on weekend nights from some of the top performers in the music industry.\nOf course, the main attraction the fair has to offer is the food. Here people can enjoy food that is only offered at the fair. One favorite is the chocolate-covered bacon treat. It is a place for those with hearty appetites. Almost any food that can be deep-fried can be found at the L.A. County Fair.",

        "content": "Learning a second language is hard, but it is better for your brain. While many people learn another language because of their cultural or ethnic heritage, it also helps your thinking. Studies show that people who speak two or more languages score higher on IQ tests. Speaking two or more languages also prevents your brain from aging. This means when you get older your chances of having Alzheimer's disease are small.\nIt's better and easier to become bilingual when you are younger. When you are a child, your brain is like a sponge absorbing information quickly. However, learning a second or even third language at any age  is good brain exercise. Being bilingual boosts your memory and listening skills.\nBeing bilingual also helps your chances of finding a job. So many companies in a variety of fields now work around the globe. They need workers who can communicate with all their clients worldwide. Knowing more than one language usually means you are a better multitasker. In today's fast-paced business world, being able to do more than one thing at a time is seen as a plus. Some companies may even pay bilingual workers more. This is why it's a good idea to put your language skills on your resume. There are also social benefits to being bilingual. Most people who are bilingual are more open-minded and culturally sensitive compared to those who only know one language.\nBeing bilingual or even multilingual is controversial, though. Some parents worry that switching among different languages will confuse their children. Some people feel that in the United States everyone should speak English only. There are even organizations asking the U.S. Congress to pass laws making it illegal for the government to use any other language on official documents. This movement has not been very successful.",

In 2011, Anthony topped the list of most hated Americans, and today she is still in the top five of that same list. This all stems from the results of a 2011 murder trial, where Anthony was acquitted of killing her two-year-old daughter. As in the O.J. Simpson trial, public opinion was highly in want of a guilty charge. All evidence seemed to point to Anthony as the guilty person. To this day, Americans still feel the justice system did not work in this case.\nAnthony's daughter Caylee was born on August 9, 2005, but the day of her death remains unknown. It is simply listed as 2008. The reason for this is because the exact time and date of her death was never determined. Caylee Anthony was last seen alive on June 16, 2008, but it wasn't until July 15 that her grandmother reported her missing. A total of 30 days passed from the time Casey Anthony reported leaving her daughter at a babysitter's house to the time Caylee was reported missing. During that time period, Casey was seen enjoying the nightlife in Southern Florida. Many photos exist of her partying away while her daughter was missing. The public perceived this behavior as unnatural for a caring, loving mother.\nWhen Casey was asked of her daughter's whereabouts, the lies began. Casey said she had left her daughter at a babysitter's house, which was not true. She also lied several times to the police about where her daughter was. However, a forensic scientist concluded that a smell coming from Casey's trunk was decomposing flesh. Casey was convicted of lying to the police, and other charges, but she was acquitted in the murder trial despite the evidence against her. Today she is free, but lives in hiding for fear of retaliation.",

        "content": "Star Wars is an American movie franchise that was first seen in 1977. It is possibly the most popular movie franchise in the history of the film industry. Although the stories took place thousands of years ago, the technology shown was more advanced than anything on earth today. It is spectacular! The space vehicles alone can travel between galaxies in the Universe, which is far beyond our present-day technology. The worlds depicted are pure fantasy, and are very popular with people of all ages.\nStar Wars was originally a low-budget film that almost did not make it to the big screen. Its creator had a hard time selling the idea to the large Hollywood studios, and was turned away several times before it was finally picked up. The franchise has become one of the most lucrative series of films in the history of Hollywood. It has spawned several offshoot products such as video games, comic books, short stories, clothing, and toys.\nThe storylines are very simple. They all focus on good versus evil. The main characters have endeared themselves to the American public over the decades. Some of these characters are everlasting because of their dedication to good, and their continual struggle against the forces of evil. Star Wars was a pioneer film series that has been copied, but never with the skill of its original creator.\nMost Americans know these films very well and many of them grew up watching the franchise. The first film in the third set of movies is due to debut in 2015. It is becoming one of the most anticipated new movies in history. It is currently in pre-production, and will undoubtedly create an entire new generation of Star Wars fans in years to come.",

Unlike Star Wars, which is a very popular movie franchise, Star Trek crosses both film and television boundaries. Star Trek precedes Star Wars by about 10 years, having been developed in the mid-1960s for television.\nThe original Star Trek series was a ground-breaking show that addressed many sensitive issues that existed in the 60s. The show featured a multi-cultural cast that included white, black, Asian, and female actors. This was unheard of in the 60s. During that time period, nearly all shows on American TV had only white cast members. The few minority actors in these shows usually had minor roles that depicted them as gardeners, butlers, outlaws, or misfits. For the first time in television history, minority members of society had positive role models depicted on TV. This diversity led, in large part, to the popularity of Star Trek.\nThe original series ran for only three seasons, but gained a large fan base in the years following its cancellation in 1969. It spawned many future series. In all, there have been five television series and 11 films in the Star Trek franchise, which is nearly twice the number of Star War films to date.\nSome of the issues covered in the original series were racism, homosexuality, gender bias, religion, and drugs. The series developers did not shy away from these important social issues. The original creator of the series had a difficult time selling his show to the networks because of this. TV executives felt American viewers were not ready to bring these issues into their homes, but the series became very successful soon after it was launched.",

These attacks came in August, 1945, during the final stages of World War II against the Empire of Japan. Two cities targeted by the U.S. were Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The war in Europe was over in May of that year, with Nazi Germany's surrender, but the Japanese carried on. The U.S. and its allies conducted a firebombing campaign against the Japanese. It devastated the country, but they would not surrender. The allies were looking at a costly campaign to invade the Japanese mainland. The Japanese were determined to fight to the last person to defend their country, if necessary. This was a major factor in the decision to use the atomic bomb.\nThe U.S., along with China and the United Kingdom, called for Japan's surrender in July 1945 with a threat of devastation, but Japan refused. On August 9, the first bomb was dropped on the city of Hiroshima. Nicknamed \"Little Boy,\" the bomb killed approximately 90,000 to 170,000 Japanese citizens. The blast completely destroyed the city. Three days later, a second bomb, nicknamed \"Fat Man,\" destroyed the city of Nagasaki. That bomb killed an estimated 60,000 to 80,000 Japanese citizens. About half of the total deaths were immediate. The remainder of the deaths came months after, when the survivors of the initial blast became sick from radiation poisoning, and injuries.\nOn August 15, after the two atomic bomb attacks, and a declaration of war on Japan by the Soviet Union, Japan decided to surrender. The reasoning behind the decision to use nuclear weapons on Japan is debated to this date. Many say that the bombs saved Japanese, and American lives. The argument is that because of Japanese determination,  many more lives would have been lost. In any event, the two attacks are the only nuclear attacks in world history.",

Nothing seemed to work.\nThe next day, Mike felt so tired during work. He had a hard time staying awake at his desk. His boss even noticed how tired he was and made a sly remark at him. \"Mike, I'm paying you to work, not to sleep,\" his boss said. Mike felt embarrassed hearing his boss's comment. He could not wait to go home and sleep.\nThat same night, Mike lay in bed and had the same problem. Although he had taken a nap when he arrived back from work, he still had a hard time falling asleep at night. \"What should I do, Maria?\" he pleaded to his girlfriend. Maria suggested he make himself some hot cocoa. He asked Maria if she would mind making him some.\nMaria at first said no to his request, but after he started moving around again, she got up and went to the kitchen. If Mike could not go to sleep, neither could she. She gasped in horror when she opened the kitchen cabinet to discover there was no more cocoa. She opened her fridge and there was no milk, either. She walked back into the bedroom and told Mike the bad news.   12. Hot Cocoa (B)",

Over time, Mike had become good friends with Maria.\nThey constantly talked over the phone and sent messages to each other by phone. When the weekend came along, they would go out on the town. Mike and Maria were inseparable when they were together. One of their favorite things to do as a couple was to go to the theaters. The movie theater was a big attraction around town.\nThe name of the theater in Pasadena was the ArcLight Cinemas. It was a famous theater where plenty of celebrities would sometimes visit. Mike and Maria once spotted a famous actor at the ArcLight getting popcorn. When Maria asked Mike if they should try approaching him, Mike answered no. Mike changed his mind when he realized it was one of his favorite comedy actors. He told Maria who it was, but Maria already knew.

Maria preferred watching romantic films.\nMike and Maria took turns choosing which movie to watch in theaters. Since Mike had seen the movie he wanted, next time it was Maria's turn to choose. The movie had ended on a cliffhanger. The ending left audiences guessing what happened to the main character. This usually meant a sequel was in the works. The people in the theater slowly rose from their seats as soon as the credits starting rolling down the big screen.\nMike and Maria also got up. Little by little, they exited the theater. There were a lot of people walking around. Mike held Maria's hand so they wouldn't get separated. They threw their trash in the trashcan, and went to the restroom. Mike waited for Maria outside the theater.\nShe finally came out after a few minutes, and they both headed towards Mike's car. The car was parked far away from the theater. It was the only parking spot they were able to find. The movie theater always gets full on the weekend. That day was no exception. Mike and Maria got in the car, and drove away.   14.

Mike took a quick ten-minute shower, and by the time he got out, the bedroom was nice and tidy. \"You take over the cleaning now; I'm going to shower,\" Maria said to Mike as she ran into the restroom. Mike went into the living room, and was shocked to discover how dirty it was.\nThere were plates on the coffee table, clothes on the floor, and the carpet was littered with crumbs. Mike picked up the plates and took them to the kitchen sink. The kitchen was also messy. He went back into the living room and picked up all the clothes from the floor. He quickly tossed the clothes into the dirty hamper that was in the basement. Mike went into the bedroom to get the vacuum. Maria was already changing into her clothes. \"Maria, have you seen the vacuum around?\" he asked her. \"Yes, it's in the closet,\" she answered while putting on her pants.\nMike grabbed the vacuum and took it to the living room. He connected the vacuum to a power outlet, and began vacuuming the living room carpet. Meanwhile, Maria went into the kitchen to wash the dishes and sweep the floor. There were a lot of dishes in the sink. Fortunately, Maria was a fast dish washer. Mike finished cleaning the living room and went inside the kitchen to help. The two finished in less than ten minutes. All that was left to clean was the bathroom. Suddenly there was a knock on the door. It was Janet. Mike told Maria to go clean the restroom while he answered the door. Mike opened the front door and cracked a wide smile.   29. \"Mother-in-Law\" (B)",

They thought she was only visiting for one day like she had originally said over the telephone. When asked why she suddenly changed her plans, Maria's mother answered, \"It was supposed to be a pleasant surprise.\" Mike and Maria were not at all pleased by her surprise.\nThey had made plans to spend the weekend together. Maria's mother, Janet, ruined their plans to be alone. It was two o'clock in the afternoon, and Janet was already getting on Mike's nerves. She had arrived a few hours ago, bringing plenty of luggage with her. \"Mike, be a dear and take my luggage to your room. It's far too heavy for me to carry,\" Janet said to Mike. Mike could never say no to his hopefully future mother-in-law.\nHe felt obligated to do as he was told by her. \"Of course, Janet, I'll be happy to help,\" Mike replied to Janet. Janet knew deep inside that Mike did not mean what he said. She still bossed him around. \"After you take away my luggage, can you serve me a nice glass of water?\" she asked Mike. \"Yes,\" Mike simply replied this time. Mike and Janet had sort of an odd relationship.\nOn the one hand, Mike despised Janet's constant nagging and demands. On the other hand, Janet was Maria's mother. Maria loved her mother, and Mike knew he had to be nice to her. Mike had to take Janet to the pharmacy to pick up her prescription shortly after she arrived. Maria could not take her because she was preparing their dinner. Mike agreed to take her for Maria.   30. A Trip to the Pharmacy (B)",

All of a sudden, the house cat hopped on the couch next to Janet.\nThe cat noticed the new guest and rubbed himself on Janet's lap. \"Who is this little guy?\" Janet asked as she petted the cat across its back. The cat purred and enjoyed the attention Janet gave him. \"His name is Tiger. I think he likes you,\" responded Mike. Tiger sat on Janet's lap and continued to purr as Janet scratched his ear. Mike smiled at their interaction. He then left Janet and the cat alone in the living-room and walked into the kitchen where Maria was still cooking dinner.\nThe food smelled even more delicious as soon as Mike stepped inside the room. \"Hey Mike, the food will be ready in a few hours,\" she said. Mike sat down at the kitchen table and let out a loud sigh. \"Your mother is exhausting to be around,\" he whispered quietly to Maria. Maria stopped what she was doing and walked over to where Mike was sitting. She kneeled herself down a little and gave Mike a kiss on the forehead.\nShe reminded him that she was only staying for a few days, and that they soon will be alone again. Mike found comfort in Maria's words. Dinner was served later. Mike, Maria, and Janet sat down to eat a typical American meal. Maria even served some left-over apple pie from a few days ago.

It was Maria who thought of the idea of buying an inflatable bed for Janet to sleep on. \"We don't have one of those, Maria,\" Mike told Maria when she told him of the idea. \"That's why you are going to have to go and buy one, Mike,\" Maria retorted. Maria had also become annoyed by her mother's constant demands. But Mike and Maria felt they had no choice but to listen to Janet.\nJanet awoke that Sunday early in the morning. She began to clean around the house to kill time until Mike and Maria woke up. Maria woke up before Mike, as usual. And as usual, she woke up Mike and told him about the plans they had made the night before. \"Mike, wake up.

Janet simply shrugged her shoulders and replied, \"I don't know. Any antique shop is fine with me.\" Maria then turned to Mike, who was focusing on the road. \"It looks like it's your call, dear,\" she said, hopefully. But Mike was not ready to answer her. In his head, Mike was certainly no antique expert, but he did know the city and was trying to remember which shop was the closest. That way they could save both time and gasoline. Suddenly, he smiled and blurted out. \"I know exactly where to go!\"\nIt was warm day in Pasadena. Maria began to sweat a little in her seat. \"Mike, can you lower my window please?\" Maria asked Mike. Mike looked into the interior rearview mirror and could see MariaÃ¢â¬â¢s mother. \"How are you doing back there, Janet? Are you also feeling warm?\" She answered, \"I'm feeling a little warm.\" Mike lowered the windows in the car to let some more air in. \"That's better, thanks,\" Maria said to Mike.\nThey soon arrived at the antique shop and parked in the parking lot. They exited the car and went inside the antique shop. When Mike stepped inside the shop, he was greeted with the scent of musk and the smell of old furniture. Maria stepped inside and noticed all the different things that were being sold. Janet, right away, began to look around the antique shop.   33. Antique Shopping (B)",

The even more clever Maria did not believe what he said and became even more suspicious. \"Why do you have your hand behind your back?\" she asked when she noticed Mike's awkward stance.\nMike became nervous and suddenly changed the topic. \"Let's go out somewhere special tonight! What do you say, dear?\" Mike asked enthusiastically. \"Umm, sure,\" Maria replied. Later that night, Mike and Maria were out driving around town. Mike wasn't sure where to take Maria. As Mike wondered where to go, Maria sat in the passenger seat asking Mike where they were going. It was a beautiful, clear night in Pasadena with stars in the sky and a big full moon.   47.

The stillness of the night added to the special moment Mike and Maria were sharing in their car - right in front of that liquor store!\nMaria was overwhelmed with emotion. The love of her life had proposed to her, and she had said yes! Mike, usually not so emotional, was absolutely thrilled. His heart had been racing prior to asking Maria the question. It was still racing now, not from being nervous but out of excitement. Maria had said yes to spending the rest of her life with him!\nMike was bursting with joy. He still couldn't believe it. \"Are... are you sure, Maria?\" he asked his wide-eyed fiancÃ©e. Maria reached for Mike's hands and looked straight into his eyes. \"I've never been more sure about anything in my life,\" she answered, tears swelling up.

The longer it got, the worse it looked, he thought.\nHe spread a newspaper over the bathroom sink so that no hair went down the drain. He plugged in the clippers and started cutting his hair. He started at the back of his head, went to the sides, and finished on the top. Every minute or so, he had to clean the hair out of the blades with an old toothbrush.\nFinished, he picked up a hand mirror to check out the back of his head. Everything looked okay. He carried the newspaper back out to the kitchen and shook the hair clippings into the trash can.",

Helicopters falling from the sky, and vehicles flying into the sky. Suicide bombers committing homicide, and two deeply religious sects going at each other's throats.\nIraqis are leaving the country as fast as they can, while terrorists are entering as fast as they can. About 30,000 Iraqi civilians are getting killed each year, while 2 million Iraqis have left their country since 2003. The US government, which has caused most of this suffering, has not welcomed these Iraqi refugees into the USA. Less than 800 Iraqis have been allowed to enter this country since the war began four years ago. What is the reason for this small number? The Iraqi people are our friends.\nThe US government tried to rescue Iraqis from Saddam Hussein and bring them democracy. Now there is no Saddam, but also there is no democracy. In the future, there might even be no Iraq. Many people worldwide, and many Iraqis, think that Iraq was better off before Bush and Cheney decided to \"help.\"",

You, as the viewer, could see the clerk clearly, but not the criminal. He was so bundled up that you couldn't see even the tip of his nose. Because there was no audio, you couldn't even be sure if the criminal was a man or a woman!\nYet, the TV news announcer earnestly asked all the viewers, \"If you have seen this robber or if you know who he is, please call the LAPD.\" To be fair to the TV station, they showed the same useless video at least six times in two days. The LAPD got zero phone calls. At other times, the TV news reader will give viewers a much better description: \"The suspect is about 5'8\", 170 pounds.\" This description also results in no arrests.",

They told her how much money she would owe them each month, and wished her good luck. Other than that, they weren't much help or encouragement. They told her how to have open houses on weekends. She had to carry big signs in her car and place them in the neighborhood around the open house. The signs were not always easy to push into the ground, nor did they always stay upright. To make matters worse, one Saturday evening she discovered that all of her signs had been stolen! Her realty company told her not to worry. They would just add the cost of replacing the signs to her monthly bill.\nAfter she had asked him many times, her husband finally accompanied her to an open house. They ended up spending eight hours together with each other that Sunday. Only a dozen house-hunters showed up all day. She tried to engage Edgar in conversation, but all he wanted to do was read the newspaper. After he helped her pick up all the signs, he told her that was the last time he was going to help her on an open house. She asked why. He said he didn't want to talk about it. Edith wondered how long her realty \"career\" was going to last.",

The Mercedes contained 11 full gasoline cans and 7 containers of nails. Apparently, the car was to be exploded by a call from a cell phone, but someone, or something, goofed. The cell phone call didn't trigger the explosion. Instead, some smoke started spewing out of the car.\nAn ambulance happened to drive by. The driver, seeing the smoke, called the police. The police arrived quickly, and a bomb expert immediately entered the car and started disarming the vehicle. A few minutes later, the police were notified about another car, also full of explosive material, parked behind the nightclub. That vehicle was also disarmed. Twice in one night, deadly explosions had failed to occur. The bad guys had lost--this time.\nA new prime minister had just taken over in England. He said that God was watching over London.  Scotland Yard believed that terrorists were behind the bombing attempts. When one patron at the nightclub found out how close he had been to death, he said, \"I'm so happy to be alive! Last night I was dancing all night near the windows next to the street, and I would have been one of the first to die. It's scary to think about. I won't be coming to this club for another week or so.\"",

Jane told Martin about the two suspicious characters sitting outside the entrance. \"They were watching us as we carried the bags out to the car,\" she said.\n\"You have very sharp eyes,\" Martin said.

Lying in a bed in a nursing home, waiting for relatives and friends to come visit. Waiting for the nurse's aide to bring medication, dinner, or an extra blanket. Waiting for help to use the bathroom.\nMuch of that time spent waiting would also be spent in thought. What do people think about when they know their time is almost up, Joel wondered.",

Only a block from her home, she saw two kids spray-painting graffiti on a new building. She honked at the kids. They continued to tag the building. She honked again. Then she got out of her car and started yelling at them to stop it. They turned around and shouted obscenities at her. She got back into her car, telling the boys that she was calling the police.\nShe did not notice another car behind her. The car pulled up next to her. The passenger window rolled down, and two shots were fired. The two boys, who had been watching, walked over to the woman's car. One opened the driver's door and grabbed her purse. The other opened the passenger door and dug through the glove compartment. Then they calmly got into their friend's car and left the scene.\nIt is said, \"If good people are silent, evil will win.\" This woman was not silent, yet evil won. The police caught a 19-year-old who they think fired the shots. He will be tried. If convicted, he will go to prison for 20 years, where he will get free food, housing, and medical care. And where he'll learn how to commit other crimes.\nBut because the prisons are so overcrowded, he will probably get out in 10 years. So, at the age of about 30, he will be out committing more crimes, while three children and eight grandchildren will never get to grow older with their grandma. For bravely speaking up, she was put down. People say that what goes around, comes around. But how often does that happen to cold-blooded murderers?",

Pluto was the first character they met once they got inside. Eva asked Billy Bob if he wanted a picture with Pluto. Billy Bob said no. He said Pluto's tail was too skinny and his nose was too big. Eva told him to go ahead, please, just so she could show daddy. Billy Bob reluctantly agreed.\nHe went over to Pluto and sat on his lap. Eva said, \"Say cheese!\" and both Billy Bob and Pluto said the magic word. Then, as Billy Bob got off Pluto's lap, he grabbed Pluto's round black plastic nose and ripped it off Pluto's costume.

In the old days, fairs and carnivals usually had a \"Test Your Strength\" contest that required a player to swing a small sledge hammer as hard as he could to ring a bell and get a prize. The Japanese invention also challenges a player's strength. Players can set it to four different levels: Baby, Girl, Man, and Arnold Schwarzenegger.\nThe mechanical arm operates at half-strength for the first 10 seconds: \"Baby,\" for example, would be \"Half-Baby,\" or 50-percent full-strength, for 10 seconds initially.\n\"This gives the human time to evaluate his mechanical opponent, and usually allows him to win,\" says the inventor. But after 10 seconds elapse, the mechanical arm instantly achieves full strength, so that weak Baby suddenly becomes strong Baby. \"That comes as a surprise to the human,\" said the inventor. \"If you watch the human compete, you will see a look of surprise come over his face at the machine's sudden burst of strength. It's funny to see!\"\nUnfortunately for some players, the look of surprise is followed by the look of pain, as the steel and plastic arm breaks their flesh and blood arm! Two players recently went to the hospital. The inventor said that he wouldn't put a warning sign on the machine.\n\"It's not the machine's fault,\" he said. \"Humans often think that they're smarter, faster, and stronger than they actually are. I think it's a good lesson that they are learning. Many refuse to combat the machine at the Baby or Girl level because they think that they're equal to the Man or Arnold level. They don't know their limitations. They're proud and foolish, and some of them have to pay the price for their pride.\"",

But a Navy official said that they had no more Purple Hearts. If Reid wanted one, he could buy it at a military supply store. \"They're only $42,\" said Arthur Chertoff. \"It's not exactly like buying a new car.\"\nHowever, the 75-year-old Reid subsists on a military pension that barely covers his rent. His daughter and son send him money for food, transportation, and other expenses. \"Well, then, let your kids pay for it,\" Chertoff said when Reid told him that he depended on his kids for living expenses. So Reid asked his son for $42 for the medal. His son got so upset about the ungratefulness of the Navy that he called the local newspaper.\nThe local newspaper printed a front page article about how the Navy couldn't be bothered to pay for and present Reid his Purple Heart 50 years after his injury.

Somehow, officials found the money and the time to buy Reid his Purple Heart and even make a ceremonial presentation.\n\"We are always eager and happy to show that we take care of our own,\" said the broadly smiling Chertoff as he presented Reid the medal in front of TV news cameras. \"Thank you so much for your service to your country.\"",

You've told me plenty of times how hot you think Roger is. What are you going to do when he gets tired of just flirting? You won't be able to resist. And then, the fun will be over sooner than you think. You could both end up getting divorced. And then, even if you married each other, how could you trust each other, since both of you would be cheaters?\"\nJenny told Carol that her imagination was out of control. Nothing was going to happen. Just then, Carol saw Roger walking toward them. He quietly came up behind Jenny and gave her a big, tight hug. Jenny grinned broadly. Carol rolled her eyes and walked away.",

Ten people died, and more than 50 were seriously injured. The bridge was being repaired because it was found to be structurally deficient; it needed to be reinforced. Like many bridges throughout America, the bridge was built more than 40 years ago. Traffic was much lighter then. Nowadays, cars, buses, and big trucks cross the bridge steadily, even late at night.\n\"I heard a terrific boom. It was like the loudest thunder I ever heard,\" said one witness to the disaster. She ran out of her car to see what was happening. She saw cars falling into the river and heard people screaming. She heard the loud cracking sounds of the bridge collapsing and splashing sounds as bridge sections and vehicles hit the water. \"It was horrible,\" she said.\nEngineers had no explanation for the collapse. They said the bridge had been inspected recently. The report said that, although it was structurally deficient, the bridge was not unsafe. Since the report did not declare the bridge unsafe, the decision was to simply reinforce it at strategic locations.\nAmericans were shocked that an American bridge could simply collapse. The news was all over TV, radio, and most newspapers. One newspaper investigation revealed that almost 10 percent (about 59,000) of America's bridges were structurally deficient.\nInitially, some people speculated that terrorists might have rigged a bomb to the bridge. Others noted that all the pigeon poop on the bridge's support rails might have eroded the steel. One blogger wrote that, before he drove over another bridge in America, he would make sure that a life jacket was in the front seat next to him.",

People can get all the rabbits, cats, and dogs that they want at any local shelter, she advised. In addition, she warned that rabbits make terrible pets: they scratch, they bite, they're not people friendly, they don't like to be held or petted, they multiply like \"well, like rabbits,\" and they're high maintenance. She said that people no sooner buy a rabbit than a month or two later they take it out to a field and release it. These house-reared rabbits often die quickly in the wild, she said. Finally, she said, there are plenty of small, independent pet shops that already sell rabbits, so it's not like there's a lack of places to get these so-called pets.\nA spokesman said that this was only a trial program for PetsRUs. The Phoenix store was the only store in the state that was selling rabbits. He said that a market survey showed a demand for rabbits, and that PetsRUs was merely trying to satisfy customer needs. If sales were slow, he said, the trial program would probably end. \"I don't know what the problem is,\" he said. \"Rabbits are cute, they don't bark, and they eat all the vegetables that your kids refuse to eat.\"",

Burton, heartbroken, told the media that he was going to become a Buddhist monk.\nUnfortunately for Brett, Katherine recently made another movie with actor Errol Flynn. This movie, \"Love in Baghdad,\" is a drama involving a married couple who are separated by terrorists. Katherine told Brett she was going to \"visit\" Errol on his 200-foot yacht after filming was finished. But soon afterward, TV entertainment shows like \"Access Hollywood\" and \"Entertainment Tonight\" showed photos and videos almost daily of Katherine and Errol hugging, kissing, dancing, and shopping.\n\"Brett couldn't take it anymore,\" said Luke. \"He was ready to settle down with Katherine.

There are billions of these bacteria in our intestines and in our feces. Of the hundreds of strains of good E. coli, there are only a few strains that are bad for us. These strains usually cause stomach problems and diarrhea.\nThe worst of these strains is labeled E. coli 0157. This strain is common in healthy cows, sheep, and goats. But when it gets into humans, it causes illness. This strain can kill humans, but only rarely. It kills our red blood cells and causes our kidneys to stop functioning. Hospitalization and transfusions are necessary to prevent death.\nMost people just get mildly sick from E. coli 0157. There are usually just two symptoms: stomach cramps and diarrhea (non-bloody or bloody). These symptoms may last up to two weeks. The very young and the very old are most susceptible to severe symptoms. In the US, more than 100,000 people get infected annually. People who live in countries with contaminated water develop immunity to infection.\nThe primary sources of infection are contaminated water, undercooked hamburger, unwashed fruits and vegetables, and unpasteurized milk or milk products. Swimming in or swallowing contaminated lake water can also result in infection. In the US, outbreaks involving hundreds of people have been traced to undercooked hamburgers at fast food restaurants, to packaged vegetable products such as spinach, and even to petting zoos. One of the best preventive measures is to wash our hands often, and wash thoroughly after using the toilet.",

Occasionally the flu becomes pandemic: in 1918, it killed 20 million people worldwide. The flu is a very contagious viral infection spread through the air by coughing, sneezing, or simply talking. It is not caused by getting caught in a rainstorm or by sleeping with the fan or air-conditioning on.\nThe incubation period is about three days. It doesn't sneak up on you, like a cold does. All of a sudden, you feel weak, you have a high fever, you have chills, you cough frequently and forcefully, your throat is sore, and your body aches.\nFor most adults, the treatment is to simply wait it out: stay home, get lots of bed rest, drink lots of fluids, and take over-the-counter medications such as aspirin, pain-killers, and nasal decongestants. Symptoms usually go away within two weeks. For the elderly and young, the initial viral infection may become a bacterial infection with deadly consequences, because the victim becomes too weak to battle the disease. The death rate for the general population is about one in 1,000. Those most susceptible to severe effects of the flu are people over 65 and people with chronic heart or lung problems, such as asthma.\nFlu season in the US is usually December to March. The best prevention, of course, is to stay away from infected people. Since that is almost impossible, the next best preventive strategy is to get an annual flu shot. This vaccine reduces the number of people who get infected, and who die, yearly.",

After hundreds of such incidents, Jake still had not gotten used to the odor and sight of fresh vomit. It was disgusting.

These chores used to be done by nurses or technicians. Now they were done by Jake. He fed patients who couldn't feed themselves. He helped move patients from their beds to gurneys, or from their beds to wheelchairs, and vice versa. Whenever a patient died in his hospital bed, it was Jake's job to zip the body into a plastic bag, put the bag on a gurney, and roll the gurney into the elevator and downstairs into the basement morgue.

How would he know where he was going to land? When he saw a nice landing spot, he'd just shoot holes in the balloons with his BB pistol, he said. He told her not to be so negative.\nHe went online and found out what wind patterns were in Oregon that time of the year. He called up his friend Duke, who was a pilot. In a few days, Bo had it all figured out. He called up a balloon store and ordered 50 balloons and a few helium tanks to fill up the balloons. His 6-year-old son asked if he could go with him. His wife promised to divorce him if he actually went through with this.",

The chair was secured to the truck. They filled up all the balloons. The balloons were actually lifting the truck off the ground a little. Bo put on his jacket, shook hands with Duke, and sat in the chair. He tied a rope to his belt and the chair, in case he fell out of the chair. All he had was a knife, an altimeter, his cell phone, a BB pistol, and a pair of binoculars. At 8 a.m., Duke took a picture of Bo sitting in the lawn chair. Duke then cut the rope holding the chair to the truck. The balloons lifted Bo so fast he almost fell out of the chair.\nBo got up to 15,000 feet, where the air is thin. His heavy coat kept him warm. The wind carried him eastward at an average speed of 22 mph. He flew over the Cascade Range. When he got near the Ochoco Mountains, he started shooting the balloons. He made a soft landing near Paulina, about 200 miles east of Roseburg. Duke was waiting for him. When Bo got home late that night, he tried to tell his wife all about his journey.  Still angry, she refused to listen to his story. She couldn't believe that her husband could be so stupid. She told Bo to sleep on the sofa. The next day, he told his son about his interesting adventure. His son went to school and bragged about his dad to all of his schoolmates. Nobody believed him.",

He had bought these plates, years ago, for two reasons. One, food cannot easily stick to or \"hide\" on unadorned plates. Therefore, they are easier to clean. Two, white plates show stains more clearly than colored or decorated plates. Stains you can see are stains you can clean. He had the same philosophy about silverware. He bought knives, forks, and spoons that had no ornamentation.\nStanding at the kitchen sink, he turned on the cold water faucet. He picked up the dinner plate in his left hand. He grabbed the pad with his right hand. Dishwashing soap was already on the pad. He wet the pad and started scrubbing the plate. There was a stain in the middle of this plate, about six inches across. It went all around the plate, just inside of where the plate curved upwards.\nThis light brown stain had been growing for months. Today, he was going to get rid of it once and for all. He scrubbed. He scrubbed some more. He rinsed the plate off. The stain was still there. He added more soap to the pad. He scrubbed some more. All of a sudden, because the plate and his hands were so soapy and he was scrubbing with such force, the plate flew out of his hands. It didn't land softly on the seat cushion of the dining room chair. Instead, it crashed into the metal arm rest of the chair. Each of the four pieces on the floor was about the same size.",

Searchers are combing a 200 by 200 mile area by air. The terrain is high desert, with lots of ravines. \"It would be very easy for a small plane like that to remain undetected for months,\" said an officer from the Civil Air Patrol. The plane, like most small planes, did not have a \"black box,\" which sends out radio signals in event of a crash. A friend of Magellan's said that he usually wears a watch that can send radio signals. But no signals were coming from that watch, if he was in fact wearing it.\nMagellan had a knack for walking away uninjured from accidents, so friends and relatives did not seem to be overly alarmed. His younger sister said that it wouldn't surprise her if he came strolling out of the desert in a day or two. Magellan made his fortune in real estate when he was young, and has devoted the rest of his life to pursuing world records in ballooning, piloting airplanes, and driving fast cars.

When you bite into it, you don't have to worry about juice squirting all over yourself and your dinner neighbors (like oranges or grapefruit, for example). And it's a silent food, you can chew it all you like without driving your neighbors crazy with crunching sounds (like apples or carrots, for example). Finally, it's easy to cut, you don't need a steak knife. You can slice it with a fork or a spoon, if you like.\nYou're never too young or too old to eat bananas. Babies eat mashed bananas before their teeth grow in. Great-great-grandparents eat mashed bananas after their teeth fall out.\nThe banana is versatile. You can fry it, bake it, mash it, or eat it raw. You can slice it and put it on your breakfast cereal. At lunchtime you can snack on a raw banana, or make a peanut butter and banana sandwich, or eat a bag of dried bananas. You can add a banana to your ice cream for dessert and call it a banana split. You can order a healthful banana smoothie at your local smoothie store. On weekends you can order a banana daiquiri at your local bar or restaurant.\nHere in the US, we get most of our bananas from Ecuador and Costa Rica, although the fruit reportedly originated in Asia. Bananas give us lots of potassium and vitamins A and C, and hardly any sodium. The price of bananas hasn't changed much over recent years, they're still about 65 cents a pound, despite rising gas and labor prices. If that's too expensive, you can still get three pounds for a buck at many dollar stores.",

As Janelle kneeled at water's edge, all the turtles swam toward her. A couple of them climbed out of the water and onto the footpath.

Then Nevin and Janelle walked out to their car, holding hands and talking about what would be the same and what would be different at their own wedding.

Experts predict that, unless it rains \"cats and dogs\" real soon, the whole city of Atlanta will have no drinking water in four months. Lake Lanier, the source of Atlanta's water delivery system, is now at only 20 percent of its usual level. To make matters worse, when Georgia water officials tried to block the flow of the Chattahoochee River southward to Alabama and Florida, those states threatened Georgia with lawsuits. They claimed that they were just as desperate for and entitled to that river water as Georgia was.\nThe Georgia Civil Air Patrol has been trying to seed the clouds overhead for the last six months, to no avail. State officials asked the local Cherokee Indians to do a rain dance. The Indians told them they would do a rain dance when the state returned all the land that it stole from the Cherokees. Officials hired the nation's number one water finder. He found a still for making whiskey.\nFinally, the governor himself held a press conference on the steps of the state capitol building. He asked all the media to bow their heads, raised his hands to heaven, and prayed. \"Lord, we are asking for relief, not for us, but for the sick and the young in this state. Thank you, oh most powerful Lord.\" The Georgia Association of Atheists immediately sued the governor for conducting prayer sessions on state property.",

Without the game of golf and the company of her golfing companions, Pat was a depressed woman.\nHer doctor had recommended the MRI exam. For a shoulder exam, the patient lies face up on a flat metal \"bed.\" The bed slides into the MRI machine, like a DVD sliding into a DVD player. The patient's nose is barely two inches from the metal ceiling. Many patients who are even slightly claustrophobic become nervous or even hysterical when they are slid into this compartment. The MRI operator has to slide them back out where they can \"breathe\" again. This happens regularly, even though patients are warned about the tomblike environment.\nPat's doctor had given her a sedative to take half an hour before the exam. He had also told her to wear a sleep mask, which would cover her eyes so that she wouldn't see the ceiling just inches from her face. Pat took the sedative and wore the mask. But as soon as she was slid all the way into the machine, she started screaming. The technician pushed the button to slide her back out. She was hyperventilating.\n\"Oh, my God! I could feel it! It was like I was being buried alive!\" she exclaimed to her husband. \"You're such a baby,\" Roy told her as they walked out of the MRI room.",

Most European governments do not allow carbon monoxide in packages that contain beef products. They warn that the gas keeps the beef looking bright red even if the beef has started to decay. This bright red color is attractive, but it's a cheap trick that allows the processor to sell possibly spoiled beef.\nIn the US, however, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Department of Agriculture say not to worry, the gas is completely safe.\n\"They might change their mind,\" said activist Maureen Downey, \"when a lot of people get sick, and it's all over TV and radio news. These two agencies bend over backward for food companies. Guess what? Processors now want to use gray water in canned soups. Look out, America, your favorite chicken soup will soon be 50 percent gray water.\"\nConan Nolan, head of FDA, said, \"Ms. Downey has a vivid imagination. Our primary concern is the health and safety of American consumers. Gray water is simply 'used' household water. It does not include toilet water. We would never allow 50 percent gray water in canned soups, that amount might make people sick. The amount we allow will probably not exceed two or three percent. People have to realize that water is getting more valuable every decade, as the world's population increases and the amount of fresh water decreases. Just as people's digestive systems get used to contaminated water in developing countries, Americans will get used to gray water in their canned soups and other products. Look, no processed food is 100 percent sterile. Consider how much rat feces we allow in processed food today.

Barking dogs, that's what!\"\nCobb says that he went to India to study how snake charmers control the deadly cobra with music. He figured that if they could use music to prevent a deadly cobra from striking out at humans, he could use the same music to prevent a dog from barking. So he learned how to play the pungi, the snake charmer's flute. And he learned many of the same tunes that the snake charmers played.\nHe returned to New York, where he practiced the tunes on his dog. At first, his dog simply barked along with the music. After hours of modifying tunes, Cobb discovered one that actually caused his dog to stop barking.\nHe was jubilant. He had discovered a melody that would shut dogs up. He would be rich beyond his wildest dreams! Unfortunately, the melody worked on his dog, but not on his neighbor's dog. Nor on several other dogs in the neighborhood.\nCobb figures that computers will help him find the right melodies at the right frequencies to shut up any dog on Earth. \"My dream, of course,\" he said, \"is to discover one melody that will shut up a whole block of barking dogs.

Sure enough, the recording told him to call back Thursday between noon and 12:30, instead of the usual 5 p.m. Damn that Gil, Archie thought.\nThursday, he anxiously called at 12:28. The recording told him that his jury service was finished! All he had to do was mail in the affidavit that had come in the white envelope. Archie put the affidavit into an envelope, put a 41-cent first class stamp on the envelope, and drove to the post office. Whistling as he dropped the envelope into the mailbox, he happily washed his hands once again of the \"privilege\" of doing jury service.",

They drink champagne, dance, and cheer at the stroke of midnight. Men kiss women who happen to stand under mistletoe. Fireworks, which in olden times scared away evil spirits, are very popular throughout the US, as they are throughout much of the world. US residents often make one or more New Year's resolutions, such as promising to quit smoking, lose weight, or stop drinking. Most of these resolutions last little longer than a month.\nIn the southern US, many people eat black-eyed peas for good luck in the new year. In Mexico and Venezuela, many people wear red or yellow underwear for good luck. In Brazil, residents wear white clothes for good luck, and in China, they wear red clothes and give children red envelopes with money in them. In Iran, people wear brand new clothes on the first day of the new year.\nIn Scotland, homeowners open the front door at midnight to let in the new year, and open the back door to let out the old year. In Switzerland, people kiss each other three times at midnight. In Spain, people eat 12 grapes, one per chime, as the clock chimes midnight. In Japan, they ring a bell 108 times to get rid of the 108 bad desires that people have. In Korea they ring a bell 33 times in honor of 33 ancient soldiers.\nIn Colombia, families make a rag doll called \"Mr. Old Year.\" They dress it in old clothes and stuff it with things that the family doesn't want anymore. Then at midnight, they set the doll on fire, to rid themselves of all the bad things of the previous year.",

He drove a 1980 Cadillac that was missing three of its hubcaps. The car looked like it hadn't been washed since 1981.\nMatthew was a skinny, bald guy. He wore glasses that sat crooked on his nose, and he was missing one of his front teeth. Every so often he joked about his missing tooth. \"Ask me what happened to it,\" he would ask his waitress. She would ask. \"I ran into a door,\" he would reply, and then laugh like it was the funniest joke in the world. Most waitresses thought he was a little weird. Each of them hoped he wouldn't sit in her section. He usually sat at a four-person booth all by himself. He often spilled food onto the table and seat. To make matters worse, he was a terrible tipper, one dollar was it, even though he usually had several free refills of black coffee.\n\"Oh, he's just a harmless, lonely old guy,\" said Amber. Matthew had taken a shine to Amber. After the first couple of months of eating at Do-Drop-In, he made it a point to sit in her section. He had other jokes which he shared with Amber, but they were as bad as his tooth joke. She laughed at them anyway.",

One of its findings is that half of the students who reach the ninth grade will never graduate. There were about 6 million students in California's K-12 grades in the spring of 2006.\nThe report focused on problems with the education system; it did not offer any solutions. Solutions might be offered in the future, if the governor decides to appoint another panel. Meanwhile, thousands of kids 15 to 18 years old will be dropping out of school every year. Without a high school diploma, most of these kids are doomed to a lifetime of part-time work or full-time jobs that offer no security, no benefits, and no opportunity for advancement. And the cities that these kids live in will see an increase in loitering, homelessness, and crime.\nAs usual, the taxpayer is going to pay for the failures of the government. He is going to be asked to approve bonds that will build yet more schools, more prisons, and more housing for the homeless. These bonds, unfortunately, are like using band-aids when stitches or tourniquets are needed.\nThe dropouts do not see a bleak future for themselves. In the report, one student was asked why he had dropped out of the tenth grade. \"School was boring,\" he said. \"I got a life to live. There's women, parties, fast cars, and easy money on the street, if you know where to find it. And if things ever go south, all I gotta do is apply for welfare.

This season puts many businesses \"in the black\", that is, into profitability, for the year.\nReporters from local TV stations interview people who camp out in front of stores a day or two before the doors open on Friday.

Regardless, each store has plenty of other items that are reduced from 10 to 50 percent, saving shoppers from $10 to $400 per item, to entice Americans to shop.\nNot all Americans appreciate this frenzy of shopping.

He was sitting in the back seat of a convertible (the top was down) when bullets fired from a rifle tore into him and a fellow passenger.\nThe assassination was caught on 8mm film by Abraham Zapruder. Digital enhancement of that famous film shows part of Kennedy's skull getting blown off. JFK was barely alive as the convertible sped to the nearest hospital; he died shortly after arriving there. The damage to his brain was so great that even today's medical techniques couldn't have saved JFK.\nConspiracy theories have persisted since the time of the assassination: the Mafia did it, the Teamsters did it, the CIA/FBI/Secret Service did it, Congress did it, the Federal Reserve did it, LBJ (the vice president) did it, the Communists did it, the Cubans who hated Castro did it, and the two guys behind the grassy knoll did it.\nConspiracy theorists do not believe that a lone gunman did it. The lone gunman was Lee Harvey Oswald. Oswald didn't get to say much in his defense except, \"I'm a patsy,\" implying that he knew who really did it. Two days after Oswald shot Kennedy, Jack Ruby put a fatal bullet into Oswald.\nThe Warren Commission conducted the federal government's official investigation of JFK's assassination. Its 27-volume report said that Oswald, an ex-Marine, acted alone in shooting JFK from a sixth floor window of a book storage building. But to this day, and probably far into the future, many people dispute this \"lone gunman\" theory. They believe JFK's death was a result of a conspiracy by one or more groups of people who felt threatened or deserted by JFK. The fact that Oswald was murdered while accompanied by a dozen Dallas policemen only strengthens the suspicions of the conspiracy theorists. The Warren report, they say, is merely a government whitewash of the \"true\" facts.",

It discovered that AA was reacting to a 50-percent increase in fuel prices in the last year alone. The memo warned pilots to put only the amount of fuel into the plane that was necessary to reach the destination.\nThe memo reminded pilots that their primary responsibility was to ensure that AA's profits increased every quarter. Topping off the tanks resulted in extra fueling time and extra weight. The extra time and weight were reducing company profits. The memo concluded with these instructions: turn off the engines when stuck in long lines on the runways; if there is a strong tailwind, turn off all the engines and glide; and, wherever it is available, use \"economy\" jet fuel.\nPilots immediately complained, saying that such a policy put their lives and the public's lives at great risk. Yielding to their complaints, AA allowed pilots to put in an extra ten gallons of fuel.\nEven with the extra ten gallons, Rogers had two near disasters. The first time, his plane ran out of fuel just as the wheels touched the runway. His plane had to be towed to the terminal. Rogers received a congratulatory phone call from AA's president! The second time, Rogers had to land his plane on a freeway, still under construction, 10 miles short of the Atlanta runway. This time the president told him he was making AA look bad. He told Rogers to save fuel AND land at the airport.\n\"People have no idea how little AA cares about their safety,\" Rogers said. \"Saving fuel is more important to management than saving lives.\"",

You plugged the Clapper into an outlet. Then you plugged your lamp into the Clapper. By clapping twice, you turned the lamp on or off. It was a convenient gadget that also became popular with handicapped people. TV commercials showed grandma lying in bed reading. She put her book down, clapped twice, and went to sleep with a big smile on her face. She didn't have to reach for the lamp switch or get out of bed and turn off the wall switch. The only problem with the original Clapper was that your barking dog, or your neighbor's dog, could also turn your lamp on or off.\nThe current Clapper works with two lamps or other devices, such as radios and TVs. TV commercials show grandma reading in bed while the TV is on. She puts the book down, claps twice to turn off the TV, and claps three times to turn off the lamp. Then she goes to sleep with a big smile on her face.\nClapper Plus is a big hit, too. It can be adjusted to respond to the loudness of your clapping. It has a light to indicate if you are clapping loudly enough. It has an \"Away\" setting for security; when you're not home, Clapper Plus will automatically turn on a light or the TV if it detects a noise. The light or TV should help scare away intruders. Clapper Plus also comes with a remote control, so that if grandma is extra tired, all she has to do is click the remote. The two versions sell for about $20 and $30.\nA $40 version might be in stores next year. Because many people feel that clapping or clicking is \"a lot of work,\" the company is developing a voice-operated Clapper.

Another is that TB is not spread by shaking hands, sharing dishes, or sharing clothing. Another is that people usually catch it only from others that they are with constantly, such as family, friends, or coworkers. The occasional cough or sneeze from a nearby stranger doesn't transmit TB.\nMany people think TB is rare, like bubonic plague or smallpox. Yet TB still occurs worldwide, killing almost 2 million people a year! Most victims are young or elderly, and live in developing countries. Yet even in developed countries, TB is a killer. In the US, TB killed 650 people in 2005.\nCaused by bacteria, most forms of TB can be treated with antibiotics. The antibiotics must be taken for weeks, however, before the victim completely recovers. Ignoring doctor's orders, some victims stop taking their antibiotics as soon as they start feeling better; they risk catching a stronger version of TB in the future.\nTB usually attacks the lungs. Symptoms vary. But common symptoms include fatigue, lots of coughing, loss of appetite, chest pain, and spitting up blood. A simple skin test, followed if necessary by a chest x-ray, will determine if active TB exists. If so, a doctor will prescribe antibiotics.\nMore than a billion people have inactive TB. It becomes active and life-threatening only when a person's immune system weakens because of aging or a serious illness.",

Meanwhile, because millions of Americans continue to use marijuana and cocaine daily, their purchases are making drug dealers filthy rich.\nHow rich are they? Local police recently stumbled upon two privately owned submarines, containing 500 pounds of cocaine, in a harbor in Colombia. Colombia supplies 90 percent of America's cocaine. The submarines can carry five tons of drugs to Mexico, where the cargo travels by truck into the US. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) officials believe that the Colombian drug lords possess about 20 of these 55-foot subs. However, they are confident they will find all of them.\nReportedly, drug lords have also purchased a Russian cannon that can fire a 2-ton shell 500 miles. The cannon, now hidden in Mexico, will be used to fire 2-ton packages of cocaine, marijuana, and other drugs into southeast New Mexico, where drug lords have secretly bought thousands of acres of desert land. The packages will land in  the desert, undetected by US radar. Once they land safely among the cactuses and scorpions, the packages will be stored underground. The drug lords are building a huge complex of tunnels and storage space under the New Mexico desert. The tunnels will connect to truck routes for transporting drugs to major cities.

And who did that biker think he was, to call Kane a name? The more he thought, the angrier he got. He'd fix them.\nThe next Saturday, he visited the trail again, but this time with a shovel. It was an old GI shovel that he still had from his Army days. It was small but efficient. He found a slight curve in the trail and, just after sunrise, he started digging. He dug a ditch all the way across the bike trail. The ditch was four inches deep and twelve inches wide. He would have liked to hang around and watch the action, but there was no place to conceal himself. Maybe later he could set up one of those spy cameras people use for home security, he thought as he walked back to his car. Then he could upload the really good crashes to the Internet.\nAn hour later, a 15-year-old girl hit the ditch. She flew through the air and landed among some small trees. Because she was wearing a helmet, knee pads, and elbow pads, all she suffered were bruises, scratches, and a sprained wrist. Her $700 bike was moderately damaged. She used her cell phone to call her dad. Despite her soreness, she stood guard on the trail to warn others.\nPolice investigated the scene of the \"accident.\" An officer said if they caught who dug the ditch, the culprit would be charged with felony vandalism, which might result in a year in prison.",

A hooded figure got out of the passenger side of a black Mustang. He walked right up to her. She clutched her purse. He punched her. She fell to the pavement, stunned. The man grabbed her purse. She held tight, until he kicked her in her side. She screamed in pain and let go of her purse. The man yelled something at her and got back into the Mustang. She heard laughter as it drove off.\nA minute later, another car pulled up. A woman got out and asked Janelle what was wrong. Janelle was crying.

Otherwise, he would have collided into the southbound traffic on Allen.\nAfter turning north on Allen, Webster stopped the car. \"What are you doing?! What are you doing?!

Webster turned on the signal, looked around at the right rear to make sure no one was in his blind spot, and got into the right lane. At Orange Grove, Webster signaled again and made a right turn. Noah told him to pull over to the curb. Webster parked the car.\n\"Webster, I'm sorry I yelled at you, but you cannot run a red light!

In his 40 years of driving, Noah couldn't remember a day like this.\nHe told Webster to pull over. They exchanged seats. Noah got back onto the 210 freeway, and headed west to Allen Ave. As he drove, he explained to Webster all the mistakes Webster had made earlier while driving on the 210. \"I thought you passed driving school,\" Noah said. Webster had, but he said that was two years ago, when he was 16. Since then, his mom hadn't let him drive at all, because her car insurance didn't cover Webster.\n\"Oh, so you're really rusty,\" Noah said, understandingly.

Darwin said that he'd buy them at Wal-Mart and install them himself.\n\"Is that it?\" Darwin asked. \"What about the  plugs and wires, and the transmission fluid?\" Andy told him that they were all okay. \"But I thought I needed to change the transmission fluid every two years or so,\" Darwin said.

He hated to quit on a battery that still had lots of life in it. But, if the DieHard failed, and something bad happened to Gilroy, Denise would kill Darwin.

        "title": "Boy Starts Huge Fire",
        "content": "A ten-year-old boy confessed to his parents that he was playing with matches on a windy day in October in southern California. The Santa Ana winds were howling that day, and his carelessness resulted in the Witch fire. That fire destroyed 18,000 acres of woodland and 12 homes. The total damage and the cost of firefighting efforts were estimated at $25 million. Ironically, his parents' house was untouched by the fire.\nThe authorities did not immediately announce what they would do to the boy or his parents. An official in the district attorney's office said that, probably, no criminal charges would be filed. But the parents would still be liable for civil charges. That is, victims could sue for their losses and rebuilding costs. Suing the middle-class family for millions would be the easy part, though; collecting the millions would be unlikely.\nHomeowners disagreed on what should be done. \"I don't have a house anymore,\" said John Ritter. \"It will take at least two years to build a new house, and my insurance is only going to pay about half the cost of the new house. Ordinarily, I would say that the boy and his parents ought to be put in jail for at least 10 years. But because their house didn't burn down, I think the law should just allow me to trade property with them. They can have my burned-down house, and I can move into their house. That's fair enough for me.\"\n\"We all make mistakes, especially when we're young,\" said Michael Richards, another homeowner whose house burned down. \"I remember setting my sister on fire when I was about 10. I didn't mean to do it, of course, and she jumped into the lake, so she was okay. But it could have been a terrible accident. I think the poor boy has learned a valuable lesson. People should forgive, rebuild, and get on with their lives.\"",

The producers and others say we're asking for too much.\" That is television writer Saul Bloom's argument as to why the Writers Guild of America is going on strike tomorrow.\nThe strike by TV and movie writers will greatly affect TV and movie production. The last such strike, in 1988, cost the industry half a billion dollars. That strike lasted five months. Such a strike affects everyone in the business, from TV and movie industry executives all the way down to the people selling popcorn at local movie theaters.\nAll movies currently in production that require the skills of active writers will halt production. TV networks will substitute new game shows and \"reality\" shows that don't require professional writers. In addition, of course, there will be plenty of reruns. TV viewers in search of fresh programs might have to switch to cable TV or rent DVDs. A recent nationwide poll indicates that the general public strongly supports the writers, who are thought to be underpaid and unappreciated.\n\"Writers are too demanding,\" complained Reese Majors, vice president of CEC Entertainment, a production company with seven shows airing weekly on network TV. \"They think they are so special. All they do is type a bunch of words onto a piece of paper. My six-year-old can do that. They claim that writing is work. But how can it be work when it is done in the comfort of their homes? How can you call sitting at home 'work'? The actors and the crew have to go on location, where they must battle the cold, the heat, the jet lag, and the loneliness of being away from home. No home cooking for them, they have to eat catered meals. But you don't hear them whining for four more cents per DVD!\"",

The judge sentenced Henry to death. Henry went to prison. That was 30 years ago. Henry has been fighting his death penalty. He does not want to die. He thinks it isn't fair. Two wrongs do not make a right, he says. For 30 years, taxpayers have paid about $30,000 a year to feed and care for Henry in prison.\nLast month, Henry was finally scheduled to die by lethal injection. But his lawyer argued that death by injection was painful. He argued that Henry shouldn't suffer in his final moments. The California Supreme Court agreed. The court said that the lethal drugs might make Henry suffer. Such suffering would be \"cruel and unusual\" punishment. Such punishment violates the Eighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.\nHenry remains in his comfortable cell. He watches TV. He reads books, magazines, and newspapers. He listens to music. Henry will die only if California figures out how to kill him painlessly.\nThe family of the murdered girl is upset. Her dad said, \"He'll probably die of old age in his sleep. My daughter has been dead for 30 years. But her killer is still alive. He eats three hot meals a day. He gets free medical care. He gets free dental care. He hurt my daughter, but the state cannot hurt him. My family and I suffer, while he enjoys life. It's not fair.\"",

If that date is inconvenient for you, you can change it to a later date. You cannot serve more than once every 12 months.\nIf you are mentally disabled or are a full-time caregiver, you may be excused from service. If you have no reasonable means of transportation to court, you might be excused. If you are a full-time student or teacher, you won't be excused. If you are a breast-feeding mom, you can postpone your service. If you are dead, your family must provide proof of death.\nTo serve on a jury, you must be able to read and understand basic English.

Blind people, deaf people, and people in wheelchairs can be required to serve on a jury.\nYou will not get paid very much for your service--$15 a day. Also, the state will reimburse you 34 cents for each mile that you drive in your car (one way only). Some employers will pay your salary while you serve; some won't.

Although the influenza virus is alive throughout the world in all four seasons, it seems to have its greatest impact on humans during the winter. Scientists are not sure why.

Finally, indoor air can dry up the mucous that helps protect people from the virus.\nIn the U.S., the virus is not something to sneeze at. It kills about 36,000 people annually (most of them elderly). It also causes almost 250,000 people to end up in a hospital bed annually.\nScientists develop a preventive flu shot for people to take as winter begins. This shot is not guaranteed to prevent flu; scientists can only guess at which virus might be the most dangerous in the upcoming season. The shot protects against only that particular virus. For those who do not get the shot, influenza spreads among them easily. It takes only a sneeze, a cough, or a touch. Victims frequently get ill from shaking hands, opening doors, or handling money.\nMost infected people will have a fever, sore throat, and cough.

Instead, the dealer ran over the agent, killing him, and then drove back across the border into Mexico. He has not been caught yet. Such incidents are on the rise, said one agent. The dealers are getting braver, because they rarely get caught. \"Any agent who tries to stop us deserves to die,\" said one convicted drug dealer.\nThe dealers are always devising new tricks to get their drugs into the US. They start dangerous fires near the border to distract agents. They shoot cattle on border ranches so that American ranchers will not call agents about suspicious activity. They use dynamite to blow up bridges so agents cannot follow them. They dig tunnels that start in Mexico and connect with buildings on US soil.\nTheir newest trick is to try to behead agents who ride on ATVs (all-terrain vehicles). When an agent drives into a concealed trap, he activates a \"clothes line\" wire. This wire stretches tightly across the agent's path, at neck level. It could slice right through his neck. The Department of Homeland Security quickly issued a new protective device for its ATV riders--a plastic neck guard. Using computer simulation, the department determined that the neck guard should prevent beheading; however, critical injuries, including a broken neck, are still possible.\n\"These 'clothes lines' are not a big deal,\" said a department official.

Five minutes later he finished his smoke, turned off the music, and started back inside.\nJust then, he heard two loud sounds, one right after the other. Both sounds were caused by falling human bodies. Two small Cessna airplanes had just crashed 1,000 feet overhead. One body made a loud cracking sound as it went through the roof of a new Corvette. The other body landed on the back end of Bert's Camaro. At about the same time, an engine from one of the planes crashed through the roof of the showroom. It killed the district manager of the dealership, who was on the phone ordering a pizza.\nThinking it was an earthquake, the salesman ran out of the building. When he saw Bert, he asked him for a cigarette. \"I quit smoking last month,\" he said to Bert. Bert told him about the fallen bodies. They both walked over to look at the corpses. Bert told the salesman how sad he felt for the dead people and their families.\nAfter a short pause, the salesman said, \"You know, we can fix this Camaro for you. It'll look like new.\"\n\"Really? For how much?\" Bert asked.\n\"Not much, not much at all,\" the salesman replied. Just then, a police car, a fire truck, and an ambulance pulled up. A police officer told Bert and the salesman to move away from the wreckage, but to stick around for questioning.",

He hoped that he could check out fast, because if that woman finished her shopping and then stood in line behind him, he would simply walk out of the store without buying anything. The checker slowly rang up his bill, took Mitchell's money, and gave him his change. It was 11 p.m. Mitchell did not look around as he walked out of the supermarket. He wondered if he would ever get that woman's face out of his mind.\nWhen he got into his car, he felt ashamed of himself. That poor woman, he thought. She probably never ventured out in the daytime. She probably did everything she could to avoid people. That was truly a face that even a mother might not love. She must feel so lonely. How could God let that happen to people, Mitchell wondered.\nLong ago, there were colonies for outcasts. Lepers, for example, lived in leper colonies, where they had social contact with their peers. But there are no \"wart colonies\" for people covered with facial warts. They have to exist with \"normal\" people.\n\"She should try duct tape,\" suggested a coworker of Mitchell's the next day. \"I saw them demonstrate it on TV. You just stick it on the wart for 48 hours, and your wart disappears!\"",

He had studied the various deals on toilet paper. You need a calculator to figure out what the best deal is, he muttered as he looked at each price tag beneath each item. Knowing that the house brand is almost always cheaper than the name brand, he settled on Ralfs Nice 'n Soft 2-ply tissue.\nThe large plastic package proclaimed \"Comfy Softness.\" The 12 double rolls were reduced from $7.19 to $5.39. Delbert read the small print on the package: \"Embossed for softness, Ralfs Bathroom Tissue is Soft, Thick and Plush. Safe for sewer and septic systems.\"\nHe had also bought about 2 pounds of bananas, at 67 cents a pound. A week ago, no bananas were available. Instead, a sign had said, \"Bad weather in Ecuador is affecting our banana supply.\"\nDelbert was surprised when the bill came to $15.91. He gave the checker a twenty and got his change.

In the capital city, Gurba has ordered the destruction of a stainless steel spire honoring Nyof.

Then it paused for one minute, while flames shot out of Nyof's mouth, accompanied by the roar of a lion.\nEvery day at noon, \"Nyof\" gave a three-minute speech talking about what a great president he had been. There was a different speech for each day of the year. Every January 18, for example, Nyof talked about how he had paved all of Akmenistan's dirt roads, by himself. Every July 3, he described how he had invented the Internet.\nAs president, Nyof actually had renamed the days of the week after his siblings, and the sun and moon after his parents. He had banned marriage.

Laughing, one woman said to the other, \"She's not from anywhere!\" The two went to their desks, talking to each other in Arabic.\nThe next day, the teacher divided the students into groups of four. The students in each group asked introductory questions of each other. A student in Tara's group asked her, \"Where are you from?\" Tara answered that she was from Iraq. The two women who had questioned Tara the day before were sitting only a few feet away. Both of them heard Tara's response.\n\"Aha!\" they both exclaimed. \"You ARE from Iraq!\" Tara smiled and said yes. Then she apologized to both of them for lying the day before. She explained that she had not wanted to get into an Arabic conversation with them. It had been her experience that many ESL students continued to speak their native language in ESL class, and Tara had not come to ESL class to practice her Arabic. In her opinion, ESL students should try to speak English only.\n\"I agree,\" said Rose.\n\"You're 100 percent right,\" agreed Jennifer. \"Rose and I must stop speaking Arabic to each other. Right, Rose?\"  Rose nodded, and then said something in Arabic. All three women laughed.\nOver the next four months, Tara became friendly with both women, although she never spoke a word of Arabic to them during class or break.",

She thought that the only solution was to break up and be just friends. She loved him, but these dreams had become so frequent that she was actually afraid to go to sleep. She was losing weight and having stomachaches from the stress.\nHe didn't know what to do. He wanted her to have pleasant dreams. He wanted her to have a life without stress. He wanted her to be his wife. This was it, she repeated; if she had just one more bad dream, they were through. He squeezed her hand, but said nothing.",

The license will cost $2,000 a year,\" said Mayor Eddie Arnold. \"I know that sounds like a lot, but these people can make a lot of money off one photo.\"\nIn fact, a recent photo of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie's new baby sold for $4 million. They had contracted with a magazine for the photo, and then donated the money to a charity for children. A couple of years before that, a photo of Brad and Angelina walking along an African beach sold for $400,000. So celebrity photos, contracted or candid, can make a photographer wealthy. But the stalking that goes on can make a celebrity crazy; recently, an actor punched out a photographer.\nStalking can be dangerous to the public, too. Recently, paparazzi in nine different cars chased after Britney Spears as she left a friend's house to go to a nearby restaurant. The driver of one car, intent on beating his competitors, struck a man in a crosswalk. The man was taken to the hospital with two broken legs. Nobody took his photo.\nThat accident prompted the mayor's decision. The very cost of the license, he said, would reduce the number of photographers who hang around in Malibu. \"Good riddance,\" said one restaurant owner. \"Some of them hang around my restaurant every Saturday. They never buy lunch or dinner. They just use my rest room all day long.\"\nThe paparazzi, of course, were angry. \"We're just little people trying to make a buck,\" said Ansel Adams. \"Most of us never have big paydays. Malibu should collect the $2,000 only if we actually sell a photo.\"",

The driver, who was not wearing a seatbelt, was slumped behind the steering wheel. The proprietor of the newsstand was yelling at the driver and shaking a magazine at him.

So, just guessing which number appears on the cube does not guarantee that you will win any money.\nSam correctly guessed 1000X, but he still had to choose between two variables. One variable was the number of cars that would run the stop sign at Hill Street and Lake Avenue in six hours.  The other variable was the number of times that a teenage boy would change TV channels in a three-hour period. This was a tough decision.\nFinally, Sam flipped a coin. It came up heads, so Sam picked the teenager. He picked right. The stop sign was run only 76 times, but the teen clicked 120 times.

You have to ask around your neighborhood or put up flyers,\" replied the officer.\nMrs. Brown figured that a billboard would work a lot better than an 8\"x11\" piece of paper on a telephone pole. There was an empty billboard at the end of her street just off the interstate highway. The billboard had a phone number on it. She called that number, and they told her they could blow up a picture of Clyde (from Mrs. Brown's family album) and put it on the billboard for all to see.\n\"But how can people see it when they whiz by on the interstate?\" she asked. \"Oh, don't worry, ma'am, they only whiz by between 2 a.m. and 5:30 a.m. The rest of the day, the interstate is so full of commuters that no one moves.\" They told her it would cost only $3,000 a month. So she took most of the money out of her savings account and rented the billboard for a month.\nThe month has passed, but Clyde has not appeared.  Because she has almost no money in savings,  Mrs. Brown called the local newspaper to see if anyone could help her rent the billboard for just one more month.

He had never opened up a disposal before, but there is a first time for everything.\nThe cylindrical disposal was about 7 inches in diameter and had a horizontal seam dividing the top half from the bottom half.

When she finished, she put the wrapper into her basket, wiped her hands on her white dress, and went to hunt for another egg.\nMeanwhile Jeff, one of the older boys, filled his basket to overflowing. He asked one of the firemen to hold it for him, and then took off running for more candy eggs. As soon as he found some, he put them into the basket of the child closest to him. Two little toddlers both saw a candy egg at the same time, and they both bent over to pick it up. They banged heads, and both of them sat down bawling. A couple of volunteer nurses picked them up and told them that everything was going to be all right.\nBy 11 a.m., the search was over. Most of the kids were studying their candy, exchanging it with others, or eating it. But then the fire engine horn blasted again, causing three-year-old Jenny to cry. A fireman on a bullhorn told everyone to gather around, because a special guest had arrived.\nOnce everyone was settled, the Easter Bunny climbed down out of the fire engine. The bunny was 6'6\" tall. Most of the kids cheered and ran toward him. Even Jenny stopped crying for a moment. She stared at the bunny and at all the kids running toward the bunny; then she started crying even harder. The Easter Bunny hugged the kids, and they hugged him. Then the Easter Bunny sat on a fire engine step, and one by one the kids came up, sat on his lap, and got their pictures taken. After that, the older kids were allowed to explore the fire engine itself.\nThe festivities ended about 3 p.m., when the orphans climbed into the buses for the return trip home. Most of them said they had a fun time. Six-year-old Sara asked, \"Can we do this every Sunday?\" And more than one boy asked, \"Can I drive the fire engine next time?\"",

The couple, visiting from Texas, had booked a room for eight nights.\n\"They wanted a sterile environment,\" Theodore said. \"They should have rented a room in a hospital, maybe an operating room. This hotel is clean, but it isn't that clean.\"\nTheodore said that, on the very first day, the couple brought all the sheets, pillowcases, and bedspreads down to the main lobby and just dropped them next to the front desk. They stood there next to this pile of bedding while other guests looked, pointed, and murmured. The hotel got three cancellations within the hour from people who witnessed this strange event.\nWhen Theodore asked the couple what the problem was, they said that their bedding was filthy and they wanted it replaced. The couple could not identify any specific \"filth\" on the bedding. The wife just said, \"We're paying good money to stay here. How dare you doubt us? We know the filth is there. That's all the proof you need.\" Theodore called room service, and the bedding was replaced immediately.\nEarly the next evening, however, the couple marched to the front desk again and demanded seven cans of spray disinfectant. \"We need a can for each night. We have to spray the phone, the TV, all the door handles, the toilet handle, the shower stall, the faucet, the sink, and any hotel staff entering our room.\"\nWorried about what their demands might be in the following days, Theodore politely suggested that a hotel more suitable for them was just around the corner. He then called ahead to reserve a \"very clean\" room, and gave them free transportation in the hotel limousine.\n\"They seemed surprised that I suggested a different hotel, but they liked the idea that I didn't charge them for the second day, and they really liked the limousine service,\" said Theodore.",

After I paid the fare and gave the driver a dollar tip, I turned around and saw that Poopsie had made a mess. I didn't have any plastic bags, so I said, 'Well, Poopsie, let's go home. There's nothing I can do about this now.'\n\"We were just starting home when I heard this voice out of nowhere: 'Excuse me, ma'am. Is that your dog?' I turned around. It was an officer of the law. Well, of course, it was my dog. 'That dog just made an illegal deposit on the courthouse lawn. As its owner, it's your responsibility to dispose of that deposit. See the sign over there? I'm going to have to write you a citation.'\n\"I asked him what sign he was talking about. He pointed all the way down to the end of the block. One little sign, a block away! How could anyone see that? I couldn't see that sign with my best opera glasses. The officer said that I could fight the ticket. He said the judge was a nice old man who owned four dogs. So I said, 'OK, thank you, I'll fight the ticket.'\n\"So when I went to court, I dressed Poopsie up in his prettiest ribbons and made extra sure he did his business first. We were both so excited. I just knew the judge and Poopsie would hit it off.\n\"But do you know what happened when we got inside? They had a different judge, a judge who is allergic to dogs, and he immediately started sniffling, coughing, sneezing, and looking around. And then he yelled at me to get the dog out of the courtroom. He fined me $100 on the way out without even giving me a chance to talk about Poopsie's chronic dyspepsia. It was terrible!

        "content": "A local community college professor decided to fight back. \"The price of books for our students is just getting higher and higher and, combined with the rising cost of tuition, it's killing these kids,\" said Peter Jason, Ph.D. \"Remember, students are one of the poorest groups of people in America. Almost half of them have at least one part-time job. In fact, one of my students has three jobs. She is a part-time sales clerk at a clothing store three days a week, then works three evenings a week as a pizza cook, and on weekends she does manicures at a beauty salon. And she still manages to have a high GPA and go to school full-time.\"\nTextbook prices are traditionally high. Adding to that problem, many college instructors change textbooks year after year; they either upgrade to a new edition or switch to an entirely different textbook. This further hurts students because if an instructor no longer uses a particular textbook, that book has no resale value.\nDr. Jason decided to make life a little easier and a lot cheaper for his students by writing his own book on public speaking. \"Many books have an increased price because of bells and whistles: CD-ROMs, lots of color photographs, and lots of graphics. I talked to my students, and many of them, like me, prefer to keep things simple. So, during a sabbatical a few years ago, I wrote my own textbook. I made sure that it wasn't long-winded. I called it Successful Public Speaking: How To Be Brief, Concise, and to the Point.\n\"Compared to most other public speaking primers, mine is half the number of pages, and one-third the price. That is, $30 instead of $90. Plus, it is published in a three-ring binder format. So, when I wrote a second edition last year, students only had to buy the 35 new pages and delete 35 of the original pages. For only $7.00, they had upgraded to the new edition. I've had great feedback from my students about this loose-leaf concept. Maybe the word will get out, and more writers and publishers will try it.\"",

The couple had been married for 50 years. In fact, their 50th anniversary occurred just a month ago, according to their next-door neighbor, Mrs. Allen. The couple was childless and had no close friends. Mr. Vittorio was a retired carpenter who had emphysema and was blind in one eye because of a cataract. His wife was a diabetic who had already had one foot amputated because of complications from the disease. Her eyesight was almost completely gone.\n\"They were such a nice couple,\" said Mrs. Allen. \"I've lived next to them for the last 20 years or so. I'm widowed, and Dom always used to help me with things like changing light bulbs and fixing appliances. They had no kids, but they were always friendly to the neighborhood kids. Every Halloween they handed out tons of candy and fresh fruit. But about eight years ago Vicky came down with diabetes, and things just haven't been the same for her or Dom. They used to be so friendly and full of life, and then they just seemed to get quieter and quieter.\n\"She used to come over to my place once or twice a week, and we would talk about all kinds of things and have the nicest time. But that happened less and less as she got sicker. So I would go over to her house about once a week and we would talk. But the conversations steadily got shorter, and she seemed to lose interest in listening and in talking. She didn't say it, but you could tell she was in a lot of pain.\"\nMrs. Allen said she hadn't even talked to either of the Vittorios in almost a year. They never came out. Even food was delivered to them by a local agency. She said she heard two gunshots last night, \"It scared me half to death!\" She  immediately called the police. \"Such a sad ending for such nice people,\" she said. \"Together in sickness, but alone in the world.\"",

I never even noticed that! Do you know how expensive these horns are? They don't grow on trees, you know. I wonder if I can find the missing piece and superglue it back on.\"\nThe sheriff then showed the mayor the tip of a bull horn. \"Do you think this is the missing piece?\" The mayor was astounded. He looked at it, turned it over in his hands, and then placed it on the horn, where it fit perfectly. \"That's fantastic, sheriff! Thank you so much! Where did you find it?\"\n\"Where did I find it? It was next to Farmer Brown's calf that you killed back there about an hour ago.\" The mayor's mouth dropped open. \"Calf! What calf? What are you talking about? I had no idea. I thought I hit a speed bump. What was his calf doing out in the middle of the road in the middle of the night?\n\"We'll settle this in court. I'm an innocent man.

The average price for 87 octane economy gas is $2.22, almost 30 percent higher today than it was 12 months ago. The lowest gas price in the Southland right now is $2.09 a gallon at the Seashell station in Arcadia. The station manager, Everett, said the reason his gas is cheaper than elsewhere is that he bought a lot of gas two years ago at reduced prices, so he is passing his savings on to his customers.\nThe lines at the Seashell station often run 10 to 20 vehicles long. The police have been here several times because cars block traffic on Horsetrail Drive. Everett said, \"I tell people in line that the Barco station a block away is only $2.14, but they'd rather wait and save 5 cents. It's OK with me, of course. I don't mind making money.\"\nA young man pumping gas said he had waited in line for 20 minutes. When asked why he didn't go a block away where there were no lines, he said, \"Every penny counts.

A food court sold all kinds of popular and ethnic foods, from American hamburgers to Hawaiian shave ice drinks. Except for a $7 parking fee, the festival was free.

The city stopped allowing weekly rentals 10 years ago because of the problems they were generating. Two, three, or even four families would pile into a two- or three-bedroom house. Then they would park their cars on the lawn and produce huge amounts of trash. Sometimes they would toss this trash on the streets and sidewalks.\nNoise would be another problem. Some people would party late and loud every night. This abuse created a lot of friction with neighbors and resulted in extra work for city maintenance crews and for police, who had to respond almost hourly to residents' complaints about noise, music, trash, and parking problems. But now, the city's budget problems are making it reconsider its ban.\nCity officials will hold a community meeting next week to listen to the pros and cons. One official has already suggested a proposal. He thinks that a fine might work. If the city has to respond to complaints, the homeowner will be charged $200 per response. Such a fine might cause the homeowner to be careful to rent only to people that he is sure will be considerate of the neighbors. The city would still get 15 percent of the rental fee, even if the homeowner's rent were totally offset by fines. The city would post inconsiderate renters' names on the city website so that other homeowners would know about them.\nSome officials think the ban should be continued because these visitors to the community have already proven that they have no consideration for others.

The park was closed because mud and rock slides destroyed part of Cambridge Road, the only access into the park. \"We had to remove tons of boulders and rocks,\" said Hugh Foster of the Parks and Recreation Department. \"Then we had to rebuild a bridge and reconstruct almost a mile of highway. I'm really surprised we got it done so soon.\"\nThe park is three miles north of Colfax on Highway 28. Cambridge Road is a two-lane highway that winds upward through Pearl Canyon before it descends to Silas Lake, which has about 20 miles of shoreline. The largest lake in the county, it is also famous for bass. In fact, the record largemouth bass catch in California occurred here in 1975. A 14-year-old boy caught a 19-pound bass.\nThe lake has two ramps for boaters, a full-service restaurant, a snack bar, a small tackle store, and a boat rental facility. As with all county parks, no alcohol is sold or permitted. More than 100 picnic tables have protective roofs and big barbecue pits. There are public restrooms with free shower facilities, lots of trash cans, and hiking trails for nature lovers. The west side of the park includes a softball field, a soccer field, and two volleyball courts. Horseshoes and kite-flying are two other popular activities. In the summer, a designated swimming area has a lifeguard on duty seven days a week.\nThe entry fee is $10 per vehicle and $10 per boat. Reservations are not accepted.  The parking lot holds about 500 vehicles; if it is full, no additional vehicles are allowed to enter. Latecomers either leave or wait in line for someone to leave the parking lot. Some weekends there are three dozen vehicles waiting in line outside the gate. Because of many requests, park officials soon might start permitting campers to stay overnight on weekends.\nThe park is open from dawn to 10 p.m. during the summer. \"We probably average  2,000 people here every day during the summer,\" said Foster. \"They come here to fish, swim, water-ski, jet-ski, picnic, commune with Mother Nature, you name it. People love this place.\"",

        "content": "Summer is almost here, which means it is time to sign your kids up for swim classes again at the Community Pool. Classes begin on Monday, May 1, and will continue throughout the summer. Fifteen swim classes are being offered. Each class lasts ten hours. A new class starts each week of the summer. Each class costs $20. The pool is big enough for six students per class.\nClasses will increase in difficulty each week. The first week is for children up to six years old.  The last week is for advanced swimmers who want to improve their race and endurance skills.\nStudents can sign up for as many classes as they like, but they must pass the skills level test. For example, students who sign up for Level 4 (Stroke Readiness) must show their certificate for completing Level 3 or must demonstrate the front crawl and backstroke. Children cannot sign up for a level they are not ready for. Children who have never attended Community Pool classes must show up April 29 or 30 for a swim skills evaluation. Instructors will rate the students and assign them to a particular skill level.\nSwim classes are fun for all. Children learn new skills and make new friends. Parents get to meet other parents in the community. Swimming, like bicycling, is a healthy and valuable skill that, once learned, is never forgotten.\n\"It's a joy to teach young children,\" said Ginger, the lead instructor for swimming programs. \"More than half of them are terrified when we put them into the water the first time. Two months later, they're begging their parents to go to the pool every day.\"",

The speaker will be James Carter, the director of a nonprofit organization dedicated to making the golden years fun and interesting.\n\"We have too many seniors who act old because they think they're old,\" said Carter. \"Our goal is to help seniors realize that they're as young and active as they want to be. Getting older does not mean sitting around waiting to die. It means getting out and doing all the things you never had time to do while you were working and raising a family.\"\nCarter will identify the services and activities that are available to seniors locally and statewide. Included are legal aid, tax advice, discounts for bus and taxi travel in the city, and free blood pressure testing on the first Monday of each month. Testing for diabetes and for cataracts is offered four times a year for a nominal fee. The city also provides inexpensive dinners called Meals on Wheels. Volunteers deliver these meals to seniors who are homebound because of illness or injury.\nAn Internet class begins this month for seniors who want to visit the World Wide Web. \"Many seniors still use typewriters,\" said Carter. \"They see no need for a computer. But after they take this course, some of them may decide to buy their own laptops.\"\nNew activities at the Senior Center include Bingo on Friday and Saturday nights, with a grand prize of $50 each night. The center is also offering Strength Training classes. \"As you get older,\" said Carter, \"you need to keep both your mind and your body active. An active mind helps prevent Alzheimer's, and an active body helps prevent osteoporosis.\"",

The agency director says that they will focus their resources on educating the homeless. \"We will probably build another school-home with this money,\" he said. \"A school-home is exactly what it sounds like. It is a school and a home. We have already built four school-homes throughout the county.  We get the homeless off the street, and we educate them so they don't have to return to the street. We teach them how to be auto mechanics, plumbers, landscapers, painters, carpenters, bricklayers, electricians, and air-conditioning repairmen.\n\"You wouldn't believe the success that we have had. In fact, a couple of weeks ago, our office air-conditioning went out. My secretary called a repairman. The repairman was one of our first homeless students.  He now owns his own air-conditioning business, plus two houses, two cars and a boat! He has a dozen employees. Holy cow! He's doing better than I am. He fixed our air-conditioning for free.

The damage was estimated at $1.5 million. A fire department spokesman said the fire might have been set deliberately.\nThe tenant who first saw the blaze banged loudly on the door of every unit in the building. Occupants of 15 units were already in bed or preparing for bed.  No one responded in the other five units because the tenants were not home. Those tenants who were home escaped with nothing more than the clothes on their backs, their pets, their cell phones, and their laptops.\nMany tenants went across the street to watch the fire from a safe distance. They were all hoping that their units would be spared. Some of the pets were so disturbed by the noise, crowds, flames, and smoke that their owners could not hold on to them. They clawed their way out of their owners' arms and dashed away. The younger children were similarly frightened. They cried in their parents' arms.\nTwo fire engines arrived at 10:45 p.m., but the entire roof was ablaze by then. Smoke and flames were visible in most of the units on the top floor.\nAt about 11:35 p.m. the flames were extinguished. Most of the roof had disappeared. The top floor of the two-story building was about 80 percent gone. Water was seeping into the ground-floor units, ruining most of them. The tenants were crying or speechless. They were happy to be alive, but now they had no home. Where were they going to live?\nFiremen discovered a charred gasoline can in the attic.

Fifty others left because the lines were moving so slowly. The event concluded at 6 p.m., three hours after the scheduled close. It was a long day for everyone, administrators, nurses, and donors. But there were plenty of chairs and tables, and many people brought their own books, magazines, or newspapers.\nThe first thing the donors had to do, of course, was fill out the donor registration and screening form. When they finished filling out the form, they waited until a nurse called them to her desk. The average adult body contains 8 to 12 pints of blood. Donors can give one pint at a time. It takes your body 2 to 4 weeks to replace this amount. Most donors filled up the pint bag within 5 to 10 minutes.\nBefore leaving, the donors received a sheet of instructions including: Do not lift any heavy objects for 12 hours. Leave your pressure bandage on for 2-3 hours. Do not smoke for at least 30 minutes. Avoid alcohol for the rest of the day. Do not do any strenuous activity for 24 hours.\n\"I wish I could hug and kiss all the volunteers that are here today,\" said Martha, the blood center donor recruiter. \"Many donors underestimate the importance of what they're doing. They think it is no big deal, but it is a big deal. Their blood is actually saving lives, helping other people to live. We cannot thank them enough for that, nor can the recipients.\"",

More than 1,000 locals and visitors strolled through the shady park daily, as temperatures remained in the comfortable 70s all weekend.\nAll kinds of art were on display and for sale. Prices ranged from a couple of dollars to a couple of thousand dollars. Oscar, a native of Peru, was selling his beautiful paintings of the mountain village of Ayacucho, where he lives most of the year. \"Every year I come to the United States to sell my paintings at about five different art shows. Then I return to my country. That is where I do all my paintings, in our beautiful mountains.\"\nPeter is a photographer. He travels throughout the southwest US. One of his favorite areas is northeast Arizona. \"That's where Spider Rock is,\" he said, pointing to a beautiful color photograph of a towering sandstone spire about 800 feet high. This rock, according to Navajo Indian lore, was the home of Spider Woman, a goddess revered by the tribe.\nA Navajo woman was selling her own rug weavings at the fair. She was busy creating a rug while visitors watched. When asked how long it took, she replied that her creations usually took months. She said that Navajo tradition was to always weave a slight flaw into an article so as not to offend Spider Woman, because only Spider Woman could create a perfect weave.\nThe exhibit areas were located throughout the park. Artists' creations included jewelry, ceramics, bird houses, gourd art, furniture, pottery, handmade musical instruments, music CDs, and sculpture. Almost all the artists had their work displayed beneath shady canopies.\n\"This was another successful year for our art fair,\" said the head librarian. \"The artists sold enough of their work to encourage them to return next year, and the library raised almost $700 from sales of various items. We'll use this money to purchase a few more tables and chairs.\"",

Clio has    a population of 28,000, but it has at least 30 gangs. The gangs make most of their money from dealing drugs and offering \"protection.\" They also commit violent crimes, such as murder, battery, and rape.\nThere were 1,486 thefts last year. Most of the thefts involved cars. Thieves also robbed the people at gunpoint or pickpocketed them. They broke into houses and businesses at the alarming rate of two a day two years ago, but that rate was down to only one a day last year. \"That's a 50-percent decrease in one year,\" beamed Gates. \"I think the officers deserve a big pat on the back. Even better, maybe they'll get that 10-percent raise that they are all hoping for next fiscal year.\"\nCiting an example of how the police force has helped reduce crime, Gates talked about bicycle thefts. \"For years and years, kids were locking up their bikes at bike stands in front of schools, libraries, and malls. About 10 percent of the time, the kids would come out of the school or wherever and discover that their bike was no longer there. Someone had cut the lock and stolen their bike. We wracked our brains trying to find a solution to this problem. Finally, at the beginning of last year, we hit upon it. We simply removed most of the bike stands. Then the bicycle theft rate came down quickly.\"\nMost cities in the state have similar problems. They all involve too many people, too much crime, too few police, and too little funding. These problems are part and parcel of civilization everywhere. They might diminish, but they will probably never disappear. All people can do is hope for the best and prepare for the worst.",

No one had to worry about going hungry in line because of the variety of hot and cold food and drinks being sold all night long. Occasionally the police received reports about people being pickpocketed while waiting in the overnight lines. But such reports were rare.

You would also be able to charge government rockets, satellites, space shuttles, and space stations $100 for each and every violation of your air rights.\nAnother time, Jones claimed to have invented a product that gets rid of calories.

Jones responded that he was very ashamed of himself, and that when he got out of prison he hoped to become a TV consultant to help people avoid getting scammed. He told the judge that he was already developing an instructional CD that, for merely $100, would save people thousands of dollars in scams.

The murals record scenes from the Bible. Arthur Anderson, an artist, and Eric Bush, a painter, had been to the church many times before. But they were not aware of any trap doors in the building.\nThe only reason they discovered it was that Arthur dropped a coin onto the floor while pulling a small knife out of his pants pocket. He heard the coin hit the floor and roll.  He started searching. A minute later, he found his dime. \"Gotcha!\" he said proudly. But then he saw what looked like an unusual gap in the floor board. With his knife, he began digging around the gap.\nThe floor board suddenly loosened. Arthur felt that he was onto something. He removed the floor board and saw a rope handle attached to what looked like a trap door. Eric helped Arthur remove four more floor boards. Then Arthur slid open the trap door.\nBeneath it was a hole in the ground about 15 feet long, 10 feet wide, and 2 feet deep. They shined a flashlight into the hole and saw the murals. They were not wrapped, covered, or otherwise protected. Yet they were in wonderful condition, according to Eric.\n\"God truly does work in mysterious ways,\" said Arthur. The murals use only the colors black, red, and yellow. The smallest are about 12 by 12 inches, and the biggest are about 24  by 24 inches. Digital photographs were taken of all the murals before they were loaded onto a truck.\nAll 23 murals, created about 1791, are now at the Museum of Native American Art. They will be inspected, cleaned, archived, and examined by experts. They will not be put on public display until early next year. Museum officials expect a huge turnout when that day occurs. \"This is truly rare,\" said one official. \"I wonder how many more treasures are out there waiting for someone to drop a dime on them.\"",

The collapse occurred after a big rig went out of control Saturday morning and slammed into one of the main supports for the pier.\n\"The driver reeked of booze,\" said a police officer who had written the truck driver a ticket for driving under the influence. \"He was so drunk that he didn't even apply his brakes before he crashed into the support. It's a miracle that he didn't kill someone,\" said the officer, who took the driver to jail.\nCity officials said it was too early to get a complete damage estimate, but that repairs to the pier would probably cost at least $500,000 and take a month or more. The local business people are very unhappy because the repair process will significantly reduce consumer purchases for the summer season.\n\"We make 80 percent of our annual profits from June through September,\" noted one T-shirt vendor. \"This is going to hurt.\"",

We're always pulling over drunks or drug users who try to fight the cops or shoot them. Then they always claim that the police started beating them first or started shooting at them first.

Ten of the 13 council members, when asked about the proposal, said that they liked the idea. One member said that it makes good fiscal sense and common sense. If the cameras are approved, they can be installed in all the cars within six weeks.\nThe police officers enthusiastically support camera use. One officer said that too many people think the police are liars; cameras would show citizens that police tell the truth. \"The money that we've been spending on lawsuits will be better spent on more cameras,\" said one officer.\nCitizen reaction to the idea of police car cameras is mixed. One person said that the police should have started doing this years ago when video cameras were invented. But an elderly man said that cameras were an invasion of privacy. \"These police are trying to stick their nose into everything,\" he said.

Many people feel that jury duty is a boring chore and would prefer not doing it.\nIn fact, court clerks say that the most common question they hear is: Why do I have to serve? The official response is: Jury duty is a responsibility that all qualified citizens must share.\nIf you are a citizen, if you can read and understand English, if you're over 18 years old, and if you're not a felon, you are eligible for jury duty. If you ignore the summons, you might be fined up to $1,500.\nA jury trial might last one day or one month. If you work for the government, this is no problem, because the government will pay you your regular salary while you are on jury duty. However, if you are self-employed, you lose your regular income for that time period. Instead of your regular income, you get $15 a DAY for sitting on a jury. This is another reason people try to avoid jury duty.\nJack got the bad news yesterday.

Your 'bad back' doesn't allow you to sit in a chair watching reruns all day?\"\n\"No. Something better than that. I've got gas. It'll offend the other jurors and everyone else in the courtroom. They'll have to open all the windows or issue gas masks.\"\n\"But there's one problem. You don't have gas.\"\n\"But I know how to create it.

Nowadays he went fishing twice a year at Big Bear, a huge lake in southern California about 7,000 feet up in the mountains.\nCalifornia tries to boost the fishing industry by sponsoring a Free Fishing Day twice a year, once in June and once in September. That sufficed for Dave. He went mostly because it was a social event with a few friends, not so much to catch fish. Even by itself, the scenic drive up a twisty two-lane road was worth the trip. Not to mention the big, beautiful houses and trees that lined the shore of the lake.\nPacking was a project in itself. Dave had even created a computer file named Fishing Trip. It was a checklist of 45 things to take to Big Bear. He took two rods, because on Free Fishing Day you were allowed to fish with two rods instead of the usual one rod. He took a hooded sweatshirt, jeans, two pair of socks, a heavy hooded denim jacket, winter gloves, and a scarf. He also took flip-flops, shorts, a T-shirt, #30 sun block, sunglasses, a big hat, and a lightweight raincoat. If you go to Big Bear in June, you'd better be prepared for hot or cold, rain or shine.\nHe packed a couple of magazines to read just in case the fish weren't biting. He and his friends joked that the fish were always biting - in the spot you just left or the spot you were headed to.\nAfter about an hour and a half, Dave had gathered all the items on his list into a neat pile next to his door. He went to bed knowing that tomorrow's weather and fishing were unpredictable, but the good time with his friends was a given.",

The exact cause is still being investigated, but authorities say it was no accident. The head engineer said everything was fine; then suddenly, everything wasn't.\nOf the freight train's 86 cars, 22 went off the tracks. Fortunately, this incident did not involve any fatalities, human or otherwise. The head engineer was treated for a broken wrist at a nearby hospital. He was the only casualty.\nTrains throughout California frequently carry dangerous cargoes, such as chemicals. When these trains derail, authorities immediately evacuate nearby communities because of the danger of explosions or of harmful fumes. However, this train carried only lumber, new automobiles, and cattle destined for slaughter.\nAfter the mishap, lumber was scattered on either side of the tracks. About 20 automobiles were damaged. The biggest problem, however, was the cattle. About 300 of them were standing on or near the tracks, wandering into the nearby woods, or standing on the nearby highway. Traffic on the two-lane highway was backed up for almost a mile in each direction.\n\"We know who did this,\" said a California Highway Patrol spokesman. \"The train was sabotaged by a group called Tofu for You. They left their pamphlets all over the crime scene. They 'liberate' animals that are on their way to the slaughterhouse. They think Americans should eat tofu instead of meat. They're wasting their time. All these cows are going to be burgers by tomorrow night.\"",

He was talking to his manager on his cell phone when he dashed out of the cab. He said that he gave the driver $60 and told him to keep the change. He walked through the front doors of the concert hall still talking on the phone to his manager.\nUpon discovering his loss, Lennon used his cell phone to call the police.

He said that she had to be kidding.\nShe told Lennon that he could file a missing items report at the police station or online. Lennon asked for the online address. It was www.nypd.gov/toprotectandtoserve/haveaniceday. She told him that finding the guitar might take a couple of years, finding guitars was not as important as finding murderers and marijuana smokers. Then she told him to have a nice day.\n\"This year has been depressing,\" said Lennon. \"I had to postpone the recording of two new CDs. I've been using borrowed guitars. And I was losing hope of ever recovering my guitar.\"\nLennon was reunited with his $100,000 guitar yesterday. The case and the guitar had been discovered in the corner of a coffeehouse only two blocks from where Lennon had lost it in the first place. Lennon had offered a $10,000 reward for its return. He said he would give the reward to the coffeehouse owner, who had notified the police. The police department prepared a news release about its success in tracking down the guitar.",

Only a month earlier she had been interviewed by detectives about Dorothy's death 35 years ago.\nIn 1970, Castle told police that the girl had fallen out of a tree she was climbing and hit her head on a rock. But Dorothy's natural father, Dwayne, who was married to Castle at the time, thought his wife was lying. \"She said she would hurt me if I bother her again,\" Dorothy had told her father earlier.\n\"Your little girl is making up stories about me. I try to love her, but she rejects me,\" Castle told Dwayne.\nAn autopsy was inconclusive, and the death was ruled accidental. Dwayne divorced Castle shortly thereafter.\nBut the case was reopened recently when a playmate of Dorothy's came forward. Beverly Lisenby, also seven at that time, said she was about to knock on the door of Dorothy's house that fateful day. But instead of knocking, she listened quietly as she heard Dorothy screaming for help and Castle telling her to shut up. Beverly listened until it was silent inside, then ran back home. She was so shaken by the event that she had told no one in all these years.\nThe coroner dug up Dorothy's body and did a second autopsy. Using new crime-solving tools, he determined that Dorothy had been struck in the skull several times by a rock the size of a baseball.\nThe police are now trying to locate Dwayne to tell him the good news.",

        "content": "The blue bike was sitting in Owen's living room. It had no kickstand, so he had wedged the front tire in between two bookshelves so that the bike would stand upright. Both tires were flat. Dust covered the bike. However, no household spiders had set up a web site. When was the last time I rode this thing, he wondered as he looked at it.\nIt was Sunday. Sunset was still almost two hours away. The temperature had been 86 at noon, but had dropped to about 76. Owen had spent Saturday and most of Sunday cleaning up his apartment. The termite inspector was coming on Monday. Owen wanted the inspector to be able to \"inspect\" without tripping over boxes, books, fishing rods, and golf clubs.\nOwen was going to reward himself with a late afternoon bicycle ride. He enjoyed riding or walking through his neighborhood with its many beautiful houses, yards, and trees. But first, he had to inflate both bike tires. He got out a hand air pump he had bought at a thrift shop for only $2. The pump nozzle adapter didn't fit onto the bike's valve stem. Nothing is ever simple, he thought.\nHe looked for his new pump, the one that had cost $10. It had all the bells and whistles: high volume air flow on both up and down strokes, quick lock valve adapter and four nozzle adapters, air gauge, and footplate for easy pumping. It was a beauty. Of course, Owen couldn't find it. I've got everything, but I can't find anything, Owen muttered.\nAs usual, Owen did find one thing while he was looking for another thing. He found another used pump that he had been looking for a month ago. It was a big, heavy, steel pump that had an air gauge and a small leak somewhere. Owen connected the pump to the rear tire. He started pumping. The \"small\" leak seemed to have gotten bigger. Owen stopped counting after the first 80 pumps; finally the dial hit 65 psi. He was huffing and puffing. He went to the refrigerator and got a diet soda. After finishing it, he pumped up the front tire. Sweat dripped from his forehead. That was a good workout, he thought as he finished off a second soda. He screwed the valve stem caps back on. He stood back and admired his \"new\" tires proudly.\nThe bike was now ready to ride. Owen, however, felt a little tired. Plus, he was hungry. In fact, it looked like it was getting too dark for a long ride. There's always tomorrow, he thought as he opened the refrigerator door. The chilled air felt good.",

He walked to the sandy white beach almost every day. Bob's Liquors was at the corner, halfway to the beach. It was the only store within a mile. It sold cold beer and cigarettes, which were the only two things that interested Pete today. The owner of Bob's was Bill. Bill had bought the store from Bob, but never renamed the store. \"'Bob's' has a nice ring to it,\" he told curious customers. Also, of course, keeping the old name saved him money, time, and trouble.\nWhen the water was unsafe, the lifeguards would put red flags all up and down the beach to warn swimmers to stay out of the water. Today was a red flag day. Fierce riptides and lots of jellyfish were predicted for the next 48 hours.\nAlthough windy and completely overcast, it was a warm September day. Pete stopped at Bob's. Bill said hello and told Pete to be careful because of the riptide reports. He asked, \"What'll it be today, Pete?\"\nPete ordered the usual, a pack of cigarettes and beer. Bill put the six-pack into a double paper bag because that helped keep the beer cold longer. Pete paid him and said goodbye. He walked out the door and crossed the two-lane street, not bothering to look in either direction.\nThe flags were flapping loudly. Small waves were splashing onto the beach. Sea gulls were walking at water's edge. Low thunder rumbled occasionally in the distance. An irregular line showed where wet sand met dry sand. Pete sat down on the dry sand. He opened a can of beer and lit a cigarette. There was no one else at the beach, except a woman walking away from him, stopping frequently to examine seashells. Pete watched a pelican dive into the water. Far away on the horizon, a stationary ship floated.\nPete was a strong swimmer. He had learned to swim when he was four years old. In grade school and high school, he won numerous swimming and diving tournaments. His parents had high hopes that he would compete in the Olympics.\nPete opened the fifth beer and lit yet another cigarette. The woman collecting seashells had disappeared from sight. He got up and walked into the water. When the water was almost thigh-high, he felt the current tugging at him. A jellyfish stung him behind his right knee. He took a final drag on his cigarette and flicked it into the water. He finished the beer, filled the empty can with sea water, and threw it back onto the beach. He looked at the ship.\nThen he dove in and started swimming.",

        "content": "When Winnie and Arnold bought their house at the end of a cul-de-sac in 1980, they thought they had died and gone to heaven. There were only four houses on the street. Between their house and their neighbor's house was a dirt pathway. The path led to a city-owned dog park, where dog owners could let their dogs run free. But there was no parking lot for dog owners' cars. Dog owners had to park on the street, and then walk their dogs to the leash-free park.\nIn 1980 no one seemed to know about the park. The only people who used it were the people who lived in the neighborhood. The neighbors used to joke that they had their own private dog park.\nThose were the good old days. Things have changed. The park has become like California in the Gold Rush days. Everyone knows about it. A dog may be man's best friend, but 1,000 dogs certainly are not.\nOver the years, the neighborhood association, consisting of about 70 houses nearest to the park, has begged the city council to reduce park hours. It is open from 7:00 to 7:00 seven days a week.  But some dog owners actually arrive at 6:00, saying that they needed to beat the rush. To save walking distance, others park in neighborhood driveways. Others bring boom boxes and play music loudly in the park. Others knock on neighborhood doors and ask to use the bathroom. Weekends are even worse than weekdays. Whole families spend the day with their dogs. People, dogs, noise, and trash are everywhere.\n\"We're stuck here,\" said Arnold. \"I've been trying to sell my place for five years. But when buyers see all this dog traffic, they take off running. What a joke. This place was heaven when we first moved here. Now it's hell.\"\nThe city council has ignored the neighborhood association's pleas for help. A council member said, \"We have to meet the public demand. This no-leash park is very popular. I'm sorry, but if the homeowners don't like it, they can always move. This is a free country, you know.\"",

        "content": "Daniel needed a new carburetor for his car. Well, not a new one. A new one would cost at least $250. Even a rebuilt one would cost about $110. The cheapest thing to do was to go to a salvage yard.\nCalifornia has about 50 salvage yards. Most of them are in southern California. The yards range in size from 10 acres to 70 acres, holding anywhere from 300 to 3,000 abandoned, wrecked, or cheaply sold cars. The yards are usually located outside of downtown but near a freeway ramp.\nA salvage yard might pay you up to $200 to take your rundown car off your hands. Before they place it in the yard, however, they will remove all its liquids, oil, gas, coolant, brake fluid, transmission fluid, power steering fluid, and windshield washer solvent. Vehicles usually sit in the yard for only a month before they are crushed, stacked, and then transported to a recycler.\nVehicle parts are inexpensive, but you have to remove them yourself. The carburetor that Daniel needed was only $20. Nothing in the yard, however, comes with a guarantee. If it doesn't work or fit, you can replace it with a similar item, but you won't get your money back.\nDaniel borrowed his brother's car. After paying the $3 entry fee to the man in the little wooden shack, Daniel walked into the yard. He walked about five minutes before he found the foreign car section. It looked like there were at least 200 cars. It was sunny and hot. There was no shade anywhere in the yard. Carrying his toolbox, Daniel went searching for a matching carburetor.\nAlmost three hours later, Daniel was back at the shack. He bought himself a cold soda from a machine. A few minutes later, he paid the $20 plus tax and walked out of the yard. Driving home, he wondered if all the work was worth the savings. If the carburetor didn't work, he'd have to do this all over again.\nWhen he got home, his brother Monty was standing next to Daniel's car. Monty had a big smile on his face. \"Hey, guess what? It wasn't your carburetor. It was the fuel filter. I changed it, and your car runs great now.\"",

He called Ira, Uncle Harry's next-door neighbor.\n\"Hello,\" said Ira.\n\"Hi, Ira, this is Teddy.\"\n\"Hi, Teddy. How are you?\"\n\"Oh, I'm fine, Ira. But I'm a little worried about Uncle Harry. I called him three times today and he didn't answer once. I don't think he could have been in the bathroom all three times, do you?\"\n\"No, I don't think so,\" laughed Ira. \"He does complain about that, doesn't he? Anyway, I'll go next door and see what's up. If he doesn't open the door, I know where he hides his spare key. I'll call you back in a bit, okay?\"\n\"Okay, Ira. Thanks a lot,\" Teddy said.\nA while later, Teddy's phone rang. It was Ira. He sounded shaken. \"Teddy, I'm sorry it took so long. I have bad news. Harry didn't answer the door, so I used his spare key. He was dead, Teddy. I'm sorry.\"\n\"Oh, my gosh! That's terrible!\"\n\"I called the hospital, and they told me to call the coroner's office. The coroner said they were busy, and wouldn't be able to make it here until tomorrow or the day after.\"\n\"What happened? Did he fall? Did he die in his sleep? Is he lying on the bed with a peaceful look on his face?\"\n\"Not exactly, Teddy. He's lying on the bathroom floor with a look of surprise on his face. We can move him to his bed later. But right now I've got to go home, Teddy. I think I might be in shock or something. I don't feel right.\"",

        "content": "It was an old clock, but it still told the correct time. The face had a faded picture of Andy's parents taken when they were newlyweds. Aside from some photos, the clock was the only memento Andy had of his mom and dad.\nHis father died of cancer in 1964. Then his mom moved to a private nursing home. She had many friends there. The nursing home, however, went bankrupt. They moved her into a state nursing home. She hated it there.\nShe asked Andy to help her move into a private nursing home again. She had spent most of her husband's savings on living expenses at the first nursing home. Andy said he would try.\nBut Andy had no savings. He was a sergeant in the Army, and all his money went to his wife and three kids. He called his older brother Frank, who was single and had a great job. Frank was an avid deep-sea fisherman and was interested in buying a large boat for weekend use.\n\"Frank, I don't have the money now, but you do,\" Andy pleaded. \"Just pay for Mom and I'll owe you for half of the nursing home costs.\"\n\"You'll owe me? You don't have two nickels to rub together, and probably never will. I'll get stuck for the whole bill. What about my boat?\"\n\"What boat?\"\n\"Never mind. Let me think about it, and I'll get back to you.\"\nFrank never did send his mom the money to move into a private nursing home. Alone and unhappy, she died in the state nursing home only a year later. Andy never forgave his brother.\nMany years went by. Frank's health declined. He called up Andy one day. \"Andy, I feel really bad about not helping out Mom. I was too interested in getting that boat. The older I've gotten, the more guilt I feel. My days are numbered, Andy. I was wondering if you would send me that clock, just for a little while. I want to beg Mom to forgive me.\"\nAndy was very reluctant to part with his clock, but he did feel a little sorry for Frank.\nFrank died ten months later. One of Frank's nieces, Flo, was the executor of his estate. Flo had hired a lawyer to help her Uncle Frank rewrite his will in his dying days. Strangely enough, Flo got everything.\nShe made sure Uncle Frank was buried a day after his death. No announcement was made about his funeral, which Flo kept private, at the 20-minute service, Flo was the only mourner. Flo sold Uncle Frank's house, car, and boat within the week. Everything of lesser value went to a charity. His cash and stocks, of course, were already safely in her name.\nWhen Andy discovered that his brother had died, he called Flo to ask about his clock. \"Oh,\" she said, \"that went to charity with everything else. You didn't really want that old thing, did you, Uncle Andy? Uncle Andy? Hello?\" Well, that was rude, she thought.",

After practice, Travis and Paul were hungry and thirsty. Between them, they had $2.05. There was a small grocery store three blocks from the school.\n\"What can we buy for only $2?\" asked Travis.\n\"We could split a soda and a candy bar,\" replied Paul.\n\"That's going to be hard to do, since I like orange soda and you like root beer,\" said Travis. \"And I hate peanuts in candy bars and you love them,\" said Paul.\n\"Wait a minute,\" said Paul. \"I've got an idea.\" They stopped, and Paul told Travis his idea.\nMr. Cobb was the store owner. He had no use for kids. They were little people with little money.

Thirty years with the federal government. Thirty years of flying out of town for weeks on end. Thirty years of interviews, meetings, and heavy briefcases. Tomorrow it would all be over. Not that he didn't like it. He had enjoyed his career.\nFritz felt blessed. His father had had a tough life as an unskilled laborer. Whenever Fritz was a bit discouraged or upset, he thought about his overworked and underpaid father. He thanked God for his own good life, and for the fact that he had been able to make his dad's last years comfortable.\nHis two children were married and had their own careers. His wife Paige kept busy with, among other things, her bridge club. She had tried to get him interested in bridge, but without success. Fritz was content with his own Friday night poker group.\nFriday morning, he went to work for the very last time. Those who knew him well would miss him. Fritz was a genuinely nice guy. He never had a bad word to say about anyone. Some people might have thought he was a little dull, but he was intelligent, a hard worker, and a team player. He had taken only three weeks of sick leave in 30 years.\nA small group took him out to lunch. When he returned from lunch, the whole office gathered around for cake, ice cream, a farewell card, and a few short speeches. They presented him with various going-away gifts, including a big, paperback US atlas. It listed all the motels, campgrounds, national parks, tourist spots, and other information to help guide a leisurely traveler throughout the good old USA.

As a final gift, his supervisor told him to take the rest of the day off.\nPaige's car wasn't in the driveway when he got home. She was probably shopping for some traveling clothes. Maybe she was out arranging a dinner at a restaurant that evening for just the two of them. That would be nice.\nBut something was wrong.

Confused, he looked around the bedroom.\nHe saw an envelope on the lamp stand. Inside it were two pieces of paper. One notified him of a divorce proceeding. The other was a hand-written note from Paige. \"I'm so sorry,\" it began. She said that her lawyer had told her to wait until today. If she had sought divorce a year earlier, like her boyfriend had suggested, she would not have been able to qualify for 50 percent of Fritz's pension. She hoped that he would find it in his heart to forgive her. She felt terrible about this, she wrote, because \"you've been so good to me. But I can't ignore my own heart.\"\nFritz sat immobile on the edge of the bed. Her note was in his hand; her words were burning in his brain.\nMaybe an hour later, the phone rang. He picked it up on the fifth ring. It was Bob, wondering if Fritz was going to play poker later that night.",

A few minutes later, some people sat directly behind Barb and Laura. Barbara couldn't believe it. The theater was 90 percent empty, but these people had to sit right behind her. She hoped that they weren't loud, obnoxious jerks.\nA minute later, Barbara felt a bump on the back of her seat. Then, another bump. Then, another. Someone was kicking the back of her seat. Barbara tried to ignore the kicking, but it wouldn't stop. Steam was now coming out of Barbara's ears and nostrils. She turned around and yelled, \"Stop kicking my seat right now, you jerk!\"\nIt was Benton. He spilled his popcorn, wet his pants, and started bawling. His father yelled at Barbara for yelling at Benton, and Barbara yelled back at the father for not controlling his son. The father took his son out to the lobby to minister to him, and Barbara resumed watching her movie. \"You didn't miss a thing,\" said Laura.",

At first he shrugged off the symptoms, figuring he had picked up a bug that would go away in a week or so. But it didn't. It lingered. After three weeks, he dragged himself to Dr. Barkley.\nThe doctor did a few tests. Then he asked Benjamin if he had gone camping and drunk unsterilized stream water. Benjamin said he hadn't been camping since he had played soldier in the army.\nHe asked if Benjamin had eaten at any fast food restaurants in the past month, or eaten from one of the many lunch trucks in the Los Angeles area. Benjamin said that he ate fast food or lunch truck food every day at noon.\n\"That's probably the source of your illness. You have hepatitis A, and you most likely got it from a food worker who didn't wash his hands thoroughly after using the bathroom. It happens a lot.\"\"Holy cow! I'm not going to die, am I?\"\nThe doctor told him not to worry. A viral infection that attacks the liver, hepatitis A kills only about 100 people annually in the US. He told Benjamin to see him every two weeks, and to be prepared to take up to three months off from work so that he could rest, rest, rest. There is no cure for hepatitis A. You survive, or you don't.\n\"But there is one good thing about hepatitis A,\" Dr. Barkley said. \"Once you get it, you're immune to it for the rest of your life.\"",

An inspector from the state's Cemetery and Funeral Bureau found the boxes stacked neatly in various rooms of the cemetery's main building. Instead of having names of the departed, most boxes simply had dates inscribed on them. The dates went all the way back to June 14, 1930.\nThe owner of the cemetery, Mrs. Marbles, said she had just bought the property a year ago. She said she had never even been in many of the rooms of the main building. She said that she had bought the cemetery solely for its land value.\n\"As we all know,\" she said, \"God keeps making people, but He's not making any more land. It's only a matter of time before all this land is going to be needed for the living. When that happens, this property will be worth at least ten times what I paid for it. I'm already in discussions with several condo developers.\"\nThe inspector said that it looked like most of the remains were from the 1930s to the 1970s. He figured that the people were probably homeless people whose bodies were never claimed at the funeral homes. The funeral homes cremated the bodies and then gave the remains to the cemetery for proper burial. He said that even though these remains were up to 75 years old, they would be buried with dignity and respect.\n\"After all,\" he said, \"all of these people had relatives at one time. They might even have children and grandchildren living right here in Santa Fe.\"",

If schools use their budgets to reinforce their buildings, they will have little money for teachers. Classes will be discontinued. Everyone's priority, of course, is to keep the schools open.\n\"All we're doing is crossing our fingers,\" said a state legislator. \"But that's exactly what they did in Louisiana.

The sedan had slowed to a crawl because of construction work on the 60. Four lanes were merged into two. The Department of Transportation crew was making repairs to a three-mile stretch of highway. Hundreds of bright orange traffic cones guided the merger. Four heavy duty trucks were parked in the emergency lanes. Their brightly glowing signs said, \"Slow. Be prepared to stop. Construction ahead.\" Vehicle traffic had slowed to about 3 mph.\nMissing all of these warnings, the drunk driver, going at least 50 mph, plowed into the sedan. The sedan driver, a computer programmer, was a recent immigrant to America. In the passenger seat was his wife, and in the back seat were his 6-year-old daughter and his 8-year-old son. It was 9 p.m. The family had been at a restaurant to celebrate the little girl's birthday. They never knew what hit them.\nThe impact of the collision caused the sedan to explode in flames. Somehow, the sedan driver managed to crawl out of the car seconds after the explosion. Third degree burns covered much of his body. His chances for survival are slim. His life, as he knew it, is over. His loved ones were burned beyond recognition. The car was a skeleton of metal.\nThe 28-year-old drunk was not only unhurt, but was able to escape from his smoldering SUV and run away, leaving two whisky bottles behind.

Frohman, a scratch golfer, had just finished an unpleasant round of golf. He said he was doing the speed limit when he happened to look in his rear view mirror and saw a car coming up on him fast.\nCertain that he was about to get rear-ended, Frohman managed to get halfway into the adjoining lane. The speeding car hit Frohman's new sedan, then hit a curb, and became airborne. Allen flew out of the car, landing on grass near the base of a light pole. Frohman, braking to a stop, saw Allen land on the grass. But the unthinkable happened. Upside down but also flying through the air, the SUV struck the light pole and dropped straight down, landing squarely on Allen.\nFrohman ran over to the SUV. Seeing both of Allen's feet under the SUV, Frohman tried to rock it back and forth so that it would roll off Allen. Not succeeding, he dialed 911 on his cell phone. Police and paramedics arrived within a few minutes. Frohman was still trying to roll the SUV off the victim when they arrived. The police told him to move back. Four of them rolled the SUV off the dead body. The paramedics did not even check the airway; they knew a dead person when they saw one.\nOne of the police officers congratulated Frohman on his attempt to save Allen.\n\"I wasn't trying to save him,\" said Frohman. \"I was planning to knock his teeth out for damaging my car.\"",

It is the belief that, in six days, God created the universe and all its creatures, including Adam and Eve, the first humans.\nSchool district officials believe that evolution is merely a theory, and a flawed one at that. They argue that, if students taking biology must learn about evolution, these students must also learn about intelligent design.\n\"There are two sides to every story,\" said Daryl Scopes, a district official. \"Darwin's theory of evolution is just thatâa theory. Not one scientist has ever proved that it is valid. The whole idea is absurd. Darwin wants us to believe that all Earth's animals, from ants to elephants, have one common ancestorâthe sponge! How ridiculous is that? We decided that our students must be aware of the true facts, as described in Genesis. God created the first manâAdamâin His own image. From one of Adam's ribs, God then created Eve. God put Adam and Eve in charge of the Earth and all its creatures. Adam and Eve were perfect humans. But then they listened to the evil serpent and ate the forbidden fruit, and life for themâand us, their childrenâhas been far from perfect ever since.

He can smell a rose, but he cannot tell if it is red, white, or blue. It does not matter to him; he enjoys the beauty of the scent itself.\nPeople sometimes take pity on him, but he tells them he is a contented man; he does not feel cheated by Mother Nature. The doctors never figured out why he was born blind.\nBut his life is not a bed of roses. It is difficult for him to travel. He cannot drive, of course; he travels by bus. At home, he cannot just look out of the window to see what the weather is like, and then dress appropriately. He can't look at the clock on the wall to see what time it is. He uses his Braille watch or a special radio for that.\nHe must always put everything in the same spot in his apartment. If he doesn't, \"I'll spend forever looking for it,\" he laughs.\nPhilip can look for and look at, but he cannot see. He says strangers often correct themselves when talking to him. They'll say, \"I see,\" meaning \"I understand.\" But then they think they've been rude, so they'll correct themselves and say, \"I mean, I understand.\"\nPhilip has never seen a good movie or a bad TV show. He has no idea what a sunset or a full moon looks like. He is a musician. He plays the saxophone, but not in a band. Four times a week, he travels to Old Town in Pasadena on the bus in the afternoon. He gets off at the bus stop and then finds his way across the street to The Cap, a hat store. On the sidewalk in front of The Cap is his \"spot.\"\nHe unfolds an aluminum chair and assembles his sax after taking it out of the case. He sits down and starts warming up. He puts a hat, upside down with change in it, on top of the case. \"The change keeps the hat from blowing away,\" he says. \"It also lets people know where to put their donations. I usually spend about four hours here. I'll earn from $10 to $30. One evening I made almost $100. Another evening, someone stole everything. I guess he needed it more than I did.\"",

Eight months after the marriage, Nora found out she was pregnant. That was good.  When she started getting stomachaches, they figured it was the new baby. But then she miscarried.\nThe stomachaches, however, continued. In fact, they got worse. It wasn't a simple stomachache. It was liver cancer. Then it was stomach cancer, lymph gland cancer, breast cancer, and brain cancer. It never stopped spreading. There was little hope, but Nora battled the daily pain with smiles and few complaints.\nAfter five years of doctors, hospitals, chemotherapy, and surgery, Nora lost the battle. More than one million dollars was spent on medical bills, more than ten thousand prayers were said by family and friendsâall to no avail. The only time that Randy asked the doctor for his honest opinion, the doctor said, \"She might have six months.\" Nora died seven days later.  Just before she died, she silently squeezed Randy's hand.\nThe mover took six hours longer to load the moving van than he had estimated originally. Randy wondered how much extra this was going to cost him. After the mover and his crew had departed for California, Randy noticed a 3-foot scar in his new hardwood floor. It looked like the crew had dragged his heavy metal bed frame. Randy hoped the new homeowner wouldn't complain about it too much. He wondered how many damaged goods were in the moving van right now.\nThe phone rang. It was the California-bound car transporter. He told Randy that his truck was at the corner of Fifth and Main, and he would wait for Randy there. Randy walked out to his car. In five minutes, he was at Fifth and Main. He gave the transporter the ignition key and watched him drive his car up the ramp onto the truck. There were five other cars already on the truck. The transporter said, \"I'll call you in nine days,\" and drove off. Randy hailed a cab.\nEleven days later, Randy got the call. The transporter said he would be in Milroy, Randy's new town, in three hours. Five hours later, the transporter arrived. Randy watched as the transporter backed his car down the ramp. The car was filthy. The transporter explained that bad weather had slowed him downâtornadoes, rain, and dust storms. \"No locusts?\" Randy wondered to himself.\nRandy drove his car to the carwash.

They drove to the beach to get a peek at nudists, but no one was there. \"That was a major disappointment,\" Erin joked.\nAfter visiting San Diego, they headed north to Los Angeles. They saw the Hollywood sign and visited many places in Hollywood and Beverly Hills. They hoped they would see lots of actors and actors' homes. If they got lucky, they would get some autographs and maybe even some photographs of them standing next to a movie star.\nBut they were disappointed. A minivan took them on a tour past actors' homes, but no actors were outside their homes. The homes themselves were barely visible. They were often hidden by tall gates, fences, walls, hedges, or trees. Later, however, Erin and Amy were able to put their hands and feet into the handprints and footprints of movie stars at the Chinese Theater in Hollywood.\nThey went to Venice boardwalk just south of the Santa Monica pier, because the boardwalk is famous for its muscle beach, weird characters, and paddle tennis. The boardwalk is one of the best places in California for people-watching. The girls enjoyed talking to the colorful locals. They were also surprised at how many people they talked to were Europeans visiting California.\nAfter Venice, they went sunbathing on the beach just north of the Venice pier. They even got to hang out with some real California surfers. The surfers tried to teach them how to ride a board in the water. That was difficult but fun. They took plenty of pictures to show their friends back home.\nErin and Amy drove to Burbank the next day to watch the taping of a Jay Leno show, but the line was so long that they decided to pass on it. Instead they went to a mall and had a great time shopping. They flew back to Georgia with souvenirs, photos, and wonderful memories. \"But next time,\" said Amy, \"we're not leaving until we see some real live actors!\"",

So she went to RentMe instead. \"I need a car for 48 hours,\" she said, \"and I don't want an SUV. I want something cheap.\" They told her they had just the vehicle for her, a 1998 Fiat. It was only thirty dollars a day, including insurance and other incidental fees. All she had to do was to pay for her own gasoline. Patricia was very pleased. Thirty dollars a day was a good rate even for a weekday. She signed all the paperwork, and they gave her the keys.\nThe Fiat was a 4-speed, 4-cylinder, 2-door beauty.

There have been several incidents in the past month of surfers being bitten or attacked by seals. Scientists think it is merely a result of overcrowding. Over the past 10 years, the seals have made \"their\" beach bigger to suit their growing population.\nThe seal-loving activists say that the surfers should surf elsewhere. They say that the surfers are infringing on the seals' territory and making them nervous and irritable. Sometimes, when there are too many surfers, they actually cause the seals to leave the beach. This, the activists say, deprives nature lovers of the opportunity to enjoy watching and listening to the seals. The activists argue that this area should be off limits to surfers.\nSurfers, of course, don't see it quite that way. They think that it's good if the seals get hit in the head with a loose surfboard occasionally, because that will teach them to stay on their rocks and stay away from the surfers' part of the beach.\n\"They shouldn't be allowed to have their rocks and our beach, too,\" exclaimed one blond, tan, thin 16-year-old who refused to identify himself. \"All these seals think about is me, me, me! They need to learn to share. Can't someone just train them to clear out of here from about 1:00 to sunset? They could come back here and stay all night and all morning. That makes sense to me.\"\nThe park service is going to hold a public hearing on the issue. They know it's going to be a tough issue to settle, because neither the activists nor the surfers seem willing to compromise. A similar issue in San Diego was settled in the seals' favor. Surfers were prohibited from using the seals' area. Mysteriously, the seals eventually vacated that particular area, and the surfers were allowed to return.",

The US government worries that citizens might figure out a way to turn durable hemp into illegal marijuana.\nAs a result, the US government discourages the production and use of hemp and its products in America. Instead, it approves the destruction of millions of trees annually to produce newspapers and hundreds of other paper products which get thrown away every day. All those paper products can be made from hemp.\nHemp was discovered in Asia thousands of years ago. It is cultivated worldwide. Hemp can grow quickly to heights of 15 feet or more in many different climates and soils. It needs little care or protection to achieve its full growth.\nHemp matures in one growing season. It's used in many products, from paper to beauty products to clothing. Like bamboo, it is used in the construction industry. Hemp is even good for you. Its seeds produce a nutritious flour or oil.\nSupporters of hemp production and products struggle to overcome the US government belief that the use of hemp might lead to the use of marijuana. Marijuana, says the US government, is the gateway drug to more dangerous drugs like cocaine.\nMeanwhile, the US government does little to prevent the thousands of deaths, injuries, and illnesses caused annually by tobacco and alcoholâtwo of the most addictive, dangerous, popular (and profitable)âdrugs in the world.",

A vicious attack on a young woman in France led to the first face transplant. To avoid the dogs in your neighborhood, you might want to hike into the desert or the woods. There, you run the risk of bites from rattlesnakes, scorpions, and blood-sucking ticks. Not to mention bears, wolves, coyotes, and mountain lions. Even as they are becoming a threatened species, mountain lions are a growing threat in southern California as man continues to reduce their hunting areas by building housing tract after housing tract.\nSpeaking of housing, watch where you go in your house or garage. Shy but deadly, the black widow spider and the brown recluse spider make themselves comfortable in quiet areas of your closets or garage. One bite from either of them can make you very sick; occasionally, people die from such bites. Unfortunately, many people fear all spiders, not just the few dangerous ones. They squash them or run from them at first sight, not realizing that most spiders are actually beneficial to man.\nIf you're concerned about bites, don't forget about rabid animal bites. Any warm-blooded animal can get infected with rabies. Although humans in the US rarely get attacked by rabid animals, the disease is painful and dangerous.

Brett figured he would also die in that now-empty house.\nHe had hired two movers at $40 an hour. They worked hard and fast. Brett was also impressed with how they had maneuvered their large truck into a tight loading area. Movers seemed to know lots of tricksâsome good, some not so good.\nBrett was a bachelor, but in the last 30 years he had accumulated a lot of stuff in the various apartments he had lived in. The movers were there for the big stuffâthe bed, chest of drawers with mirror, refrigerator, computer desk, coffee table, dining room table, TVs, stereo, sofa, and, of course, the books. Earlier, Brett had packed more than a thousand books into cardboard boxes and sturdy paper bags. More books than he would ever have time to read, unless scientists discovered a cure for the aging process. What a day that would be!\nThe movers were finished in only four hours. Brett gave them each a $10 tip. He wondered if that would be an insult or a compliment. They smiled and said thanks. He told them he would meet them at the house in a few hours.\nThe apartment now looked a lot bigger, but there was still a lot of work to be done. All the big things were gone, but there were lots of smaller things. The kitchen cabinets were still full of dishes, plastic ware, and canned and packaged food. All the towels, bedding, and clothes were still in the bedroom and bathroom. In the living room and hall closet were his golf clubs, fishing rods, and toolboxes.\nHe was going to have to pack all this by himself and then make many car trips to his parents' house. He had thought about asking his best friend for some help, but then decided against that. Jerome had helped Brett make his last two moves. You can ask your friends to help you move only so often before they start being less friendly. Brett decided, if worse came to worst, he'd just pack all the remaining things and then hire the movers again.",

At least he thought he had; no one had ever called him back to confirm his reservation. Probably a confirmation call wasn't even necessary, he thought.\nHe didn't feel comfortable giving blood nowadays, no matter how much they talked about the unlikelihood of getting infections. As far as Gabriel was concerned, if anything involved humans, it also involved the possibility of human error. But he was willing to take the risk because he liked to think that this was his way of \"giving back\" to his community.\nWhen he started his car, he knew the gas station would be his first stop after the gym. He wouldn't have time to gas up before his appointment, because long gas lines were a daily problem as people tried to beat the rising gas prices.\nGabriel walked into the gym. No other donors were there. Six staff people, identified by their \"Give Life\" T-shirts, were inside the gym. He walked over to Andrew, the staff supervisor.\n\"I have an appointment at two o'clock to donate my blood,\" he said.\n\"Well, we're ready if you are,\" said Andrew, smiling.\n\"I'm ready, willing, and able.\"\n\"Great! Just fill out this form.\"\nGabriel filled out the form in just a few minutes, and then gave it back to Andrew. Andrew gave the form to Alexis, who asked Gabriel to sit down at her table. She asked him if he liked the new forms. Gabriel asked what was new about them.\n\"I don't have to ask you about 30 questions that I used to have to ask you, so they save both of us time.\" She asked Gabriel to hold out his hand.\n\"Which finger do you prefer?\" she asked, as she unwrapped the needle that she was going to prick his finger with to get a blood sample.\n\"Oh, it doesn't matter. They're all the same to me. Where is everybody? The last time I was here, the gym was full,\" Gabriel said.\n\"I don't know. It's not even 2:15 yet. I'm sure it will start to get busy shortly. We're hoping that everyone shows up,\" Alexis said.\n\"Maybe you ought to give away free T-shirts to encourage a good turnout,\" Gabriel suggested.\n\"Or free gas to guarantee one,\" Alexis smiled.",

A breeze occasionally stirred the leaves.\nMost days in LA are hot. December and January are usually rainy and, for some reason, June is usually cool and overcast. Although many locals find June weather to be refreshingly cool, the local TV weather people complain daily. \"When is the 'June gloom' going to end?\" they ask.\nEventually, of course, the gray June sky changes to a blue sky with very high temperatures. For the next five months, the local TV weather people complain about how hot it is, and get excited when the temperature drops five degrees.\nWinter in LA means rain. Rain excites the local TV weather people. They get to remind viewers to remember their umbrellas, watch out for traffic, and drive extra carefully! They get to say \"storm warning!\" More than half the time, no storm follows the storm warning.\nWhen a big storm hits LA, the local TV weather people show close-ups of big puddles in the streets, close-ups of windshield wipers wiping away raindrops, and close-ups of wet people waiting at bus stops. Sometimes they show close-ups of TV reporters standing ankle-deep in raging streams.\nFor some reason, the local TV weather people never have much to say about a perfect day like today.",

It was a new coffeehouse which served 45 kinds of coffee and tea. He liked it because the coffee was good and the place was never overcrowded.\nThe coffeehouse was only a 10-minute walk, which Blair now took. There were three female customers in the coffeehouse. None of them were young and pretty. Blair was a little disappointed. He'd prefer to see good-looking women while he was drinking good coffee, but you can't have everything.\nHe ordered a large \"coffee of the day,\" which was $1.70. He gave the clerk two dollars. He put the change in the tip jar and took his coffee outside. Blair preferred to drink outside. That way he could watch the traffic on the street. He liked to try to spot British motorcycles and 1960 station wagons.\nHe sat at a table under an umbrella, opened his book, and began reading. The book was a self-improvement book. Blair had been reading it on and off for about two years. He hadn't noticed any improvement. A woman was approaching the patio. Blair looked up to see if she was attractive. She was. And she was by herself. He returned to the book as she passed by him. Blair kept looking at the pages, but his mind was on the woman.\nA few minutes later, she came outside holding a cup of coffee and sat at the table right next to Blair's. Her chair was so close to his that he could have reached over and touched her on her right shoulder. There were four other empty tables on the patio. Why had she sat at this one, so close to him? Was she telling him that she was available? Was she hoping that he would make a move?\nBlair went back to his book. But he wasn't reading the words; he was thinking about the woman. What could he say to her? How could he break the ice? What was a good line? \"What blend are you drinking?\" \"Your perfume smells nice.\" \"Weren't we in the same art class?\"\nBut maybe she wasn't interested in him at all. Maybe she just wanted to sit and drink in peace. Yet why would she sit right here? His head was spinning. He must say something.\nJust then, her cell phone rang. She answered it, then laughed, then started talking animatedly. That's got to be her boyfriend, Blair thought.\nBut from the moment she answered the phone, it didn't matter if she had a boyfriend or not, because she was speaking another language. Blair was not interested in a girl who didn't speak English. He went back to his book and his coffee. It tasted good.",

Suddenly, the loudest thunder they'd ever heard seemed to explode right out of the ceiling, the floor, and the walls. They were thrown onto the floor. The dresser, on the other side of the bed, crashed onto the bed, which was shaking and bouncing violently. Paintings and a mirror flew off the bedroom walls. Their bedroom windows broke and the walls cracked as the foundation of the house moved.\nThe Northridge quake was \"only\" 6.8 on the Richter scale (10 is maximum). There have been many earthquakes stronger than the Northridge one. The strongest quake ever recorded, 9.5, occurred in Chile in 1960.\nEach whole number on the Richter scale equals ten times the energy of the previous number. That is, a 3.0 quake is ten times as powerful as a 2.0 quake. Quakes are measured on instruments called seismographs.\nEarthquakes usually occur where tectonic plates meet. About 30 of these plates cover the Earth. They are several miles thick and huge in areaâmost of the Pacific Ocean sits on just one plate.\nEarthquakes occur when one plate strikes another or slides beneath another. Either action produces a huge amount of energy that travels upwards to the surface of the land or upwards to the surface of the ocean floor. A powerful earthquake on the ocean floor produces a tsunami.\nIt is well-known that various kinds of animals act oddly just before an earthquake occurs. Researchers hope to discover how these animals can actually detect an earthquake. They'll use that knowledge to try to create an early warning system to save human lives. We'll never be able to take the power out of an earthquake, but maybe someday we can take out the surprise.",

But it's an amazing fact.\nSixty times a minute for 60 minutes is 3,600 times. What physical thing can most of us do 3,600 times in one hour? Blink? Maybe. Tap our fingers on the desk? Nope. Jump up and down? Certainly not! But our heart keeps beating, hour after hour. Every day, it pumps almost 2,000 gallons of blood through our blood vessels. It takes you about five years to drink 2,000 gallons of water.\nAnd, unlike your knees or your back, your heart does all this work without ever complaining! You never know that it's even there. Your heart is such a reliable \"silent partner\" that people forget to care for it. For many, the first indication that their heart isn't functioning properly is a fatal heart attack! Over 650,000 Americans die annually of some kind of heart disease. Cancer kills 560,000, stroke kills 143,000, and accidents kill 118,000 Americans annually.\nLike accidental deaths, many heart disease-related deaths can be avoided if people simply follow the advice of the experts.

He lay next to his motorcycle for 20 minutes before a passerby noticed the wreckage.\nA half hour later, the rider was lying on a gurney in the local hospital. Moaning in pain, he was unaware of his condition or whereabouts. The emergency room doctors gave him no medicationâthey needed to examine him thoroughly before taking him to surgery.\nHis jaw was broken, as were all three bones in his right leg. Part of his femur was protruding through his thigh, and there was a deep hole in his shin just below his knee. Dr. Kildare wanted to amputate the rider's leg just below the knee. He said the hole in the shin was so deep that infection would be inevitable. He figured amputation now would be better than amputation later.\nDr. Welby disagreed. He said the patient was young enough to heal rapidly, with little possibility of significant infection. Since Dr. Welby was in charge, the patient was allowed to keep his leg.\nThe day following surgery, the patient achieved brief consciousness in his hospital room. He didn't notice that his leg was suspended and completely immobilized. He didn't notice that there was an IV tube and needle taped into the back of each hand. He didn't notice that his jaw was wired shut. All he noticed was that a beautiful young nurse was looking at him. He tried to introduce himself, but he had no idea what his name was.

The brain reads these impulses and \"tells\" you what you are seeing. The image that the retina receives is upside down, but the brain reverses it to right-side up.\nIn an experiment years ago, a brave researcher wore special lenses that turned everything upside down. After stumbling around for awhile, he became used to the lenses because his brain corrected the images. To conclude his experiment, he stopped wearing the lenses. After awhile, his brain returned his vision to normal.\nPeople with vision problems are usually near-sighted or far-sighted. Near-sighted people see clearly only objects that are near; far-sighted people see clearly only objects that are far away. Both groups of people need corrective lenses (glasses or contacts).\nPeople whose near and far vision is good have \"20/20\" vision. People with poor eyesight might have 20/40 vision (or worse). That is, a person with good vision can see an object from 40 feet away as clearly as a person with poor vision can see the object from 20 feet away. No matter how good your vision is when you are young, you will need reading glasses when you get old.\nYour pupils get bigger as a light source gets dimmer, but your pupils also get bigger if you see something (like a delicious meal) that interests you. \"Your eyes are bigger than your stomach\" is an expression parents use when a child fills his plate with more food than he can eat.",

This is partly because the Food and Drug Administration and the Department of Agriculture often seem more interested in the welfare of the food industry than in the health of consumers.\nFor example, even though health practitioners and the federal government itself tell consumers to watch their salt intake, processors continue to add salt to packaged food. Salt occurs naturally in many foods, so why do processors add more? Perhaps processors think that extra salty food will make the consumers thirsty enough to buy more soda and other beverages that the processors also make.\n\"Serving Size\" is supposed to be the amount an average adult would eat at one sitting as part of a regular meal. However, a 6-ounce container may have anywhere from 1 to 3 servings, depending on the food inside the container. A 6-ounce can of Crabmeat contains one serving, while a 6-ounce can of Pink Salmon Chunks contains 3 servings.\nWith the federal government's approval, processors use labeling that helps to sell the product, regardless of how confusing or deceptive the label is to the consumer. If a consumer sees \"200 calories\" on a can of tuna fish, he might not buy it because 200 is a lot of calories. But if the consumer sees \"20 calories\" (because the can of tuna fish has 10 servings!), he doesn't worry that the can contains too many calories. All he sees is the number 20. That makes him happy, and it makes the processor happy.",

She looked around. \"Hello,\" she said loudly. \"Is anyone there?\" Nobody answered. The scratching continued. She got up from her desk. She walked over to where the sound was coming from. She looked in a trashcan. She saw a small rat. It was trying to climb up the side of the plastic trashcan, but it was making no progress. Its claws were useless on the hard plastic. \"How did you even get IN here?\" she asked the animal.\nShe picked up another trashcan. She slid that trashcan into the trashcan with the rat in it. She walked downstairs carrying both trashcans. She went over to the security guard's desk. \"I have something for you. I think it's still alive,\" she said. She gave him the trashcans. He pulled out the top trashcan. He said, \"Well, one down. How many to go? There are dozens of rats in this building. They're most active at night.\" She said, \"Well, this is my first rat, and I hope it's my last. What happens if one of these things bites me?\" She went back upstairs.\nA week later, she was working in her office around lunchtime. The heat was on in the building. She smelled something. It wasn't a good smell. At first, she thought it was a coworker's body odor. Then she thought it was a coworker's lunch. Then she thought it was a dead animal. She walked over to her manager's desk. \"Something smells really bad. I think there's something dead in our office,\" she said. He said, \"I hope it's not Mr. Evans. He's getting up there. I can't smell anything. Where is the smell coming from?\"\nShe led him over to the heating vent near the windows. He put his nose down near the vent. \"Phew!\" he said, as he jerked his head back. He called maintenance. A worker arrived a few minutes later. He opened the vent. He found two dead rats inside. Shelly's manager said, \"Boy, Shelly, what a good nose you have! How about coming up to the tenth floor with me and sniffing around? Maybe we have dead rats up there too.\"",

They are taking pictures of what they eat or taking pictures of themselves, which is called \"selfies\". When people are not oversharing, they are constantly reading or looking at what friends and family members are posting. Social media is becoming addicting.\nResearch shows that most people spend on average almost 4 hours a day on social networking sites. That's almost 30 hours a week. While some people need and use social media for work or to stay in touch with friends, other people find that using social media so much causes anxiety and stress. People also tend to use social media as a way to procrastinate. So just as many religions ask people to abstain, or not to have certain foods or drinks for a certain time, many people are taking social media fasts. They are not updating their statuses, and they are also not reading what other people are posting. They choose to stay away from social media for 30 days.\nIronically, the details of these fasts can be found on social networking sites all over the Internet. The reasons people undertake a fast are varied. Some people want to reconnect with their families or friends by disconnecting  from their cell phones. Some people want to be more productive at work. What did some fasters do instead of logging on? Some decided to connect with friends by actually sitting down and having face-to-face conversations. If friends or loved ones were far away, they would call them on the telephone instead. Some even wrote handwritten postcards or letters. The results were mixed. Some people felt that not using social media made them more anxious. Others developed more positive habits like journaling or meditating.",

According to the Los Angeles Police Department, over 200 uniformed officers were sent to the parade to make sure everything went okay. Although the parade went by without a problem, the LAPD's Public Information Officer said that there was an increase in alcohol related arrests than when the Kings won the Stanley Cup in 2012.\nAccording to Christopher Harris, who attended the parade with his family, a lot of people who attended the parade had gone to the bars surrounding the Staples Center, and had gotten drunk before attending the parade. \"I saw one person throw up on the street in front of a policeman. They put him in the back of the police car,\" Harris said. The cheers from the crowd started getting louder and louder as the players from the Kings started passing by.\nRobert Lopez, who attended the parade even though he was rooting for the New York Rangers, said that the Kings fans started getting really annoying. He was pretty sure it was because of the alcohol; everyone seemed pretty drunk. Lopez said that he was glad that he didn't bring his New York Rangers jersey, as he originally planned on, because he said people would have definitely thrown stuff at him.\nA public relations worker for Los Angeles Kings issued a statement for the hockey organization saying that they do not condone people to drink before going to attend the parade. He went on to say that they took the precaution of having the parade start earlier than it did in 2012 so that people didn't have a chance to go get a drink. It seems as if it still failed.",

She remembers turning to her aunt to say, \"I'm going on a ship like that one day, auntie.\"\nTrue to her words, Susan left Nebraska, and moved to Los Angeles, California. She wanted to live near the ocean, and was delighted to discover the Queen Mary was permanently docked in Long Beach. The grand ship, which has the same size of the Titanic, is now a museum and tourist attraction. She didn't hesitate to book a tour of the ship. \"This is wonderful,\"  she thought to herself.\nUpon arriving on board, Susan was not disappointed. It was everything she hoped it would be. The ship was restored to its original state, which was very luxurious. The tour she took highlighted the ship's history and importance over the years. She ate at one of the three restaurants, and stayed the night in the ship's hotel. The Queen Mary was built in the 1930s in Great Britain, and enjoyed many years sailing across the Atlantic Ocean. It was host to many dignitaries such as Winston Churchill, the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, and many Hollywood celebrities. During World War II, the ship was assigned as a troop transport where it was used to transport up to 18,000 Allied soldiers per trip.\nAfter the war, it was restored to its original state, and began its transatlantic travels. In 1967, the city of Long Beach purchased the aging ocean liner, and it has been a popular attraction for the city ever since. \"It is living history,\" said Susan, after her visit.",

During the 1960s, music in the United States was greatly influenced by the social issues of the day. Many call the decade a revolutionary period in the country's history, and music was a big part of that revolution.\nWhen David was young, he was in love with the Beatles. The English band was possibly the most impactful group of the generation. It revolutionized music like no band or artist before them. Most young boys wanted to be Paul McCartney, or John Lennon - the two founders of the band. Becoming rich and famous in America is one of the attractions of living in the U.S., and becoming a rock star is one way of achieving this. David knew this, so he got together with three of his friends and convinced them to form a band together.\nMany American Rock 'N' Roll bands began their journey in someone's garage. One notable group to start this way was Van Halen. David and his friends were convinced they could become the next Beatles with a little luck and a lot of practice.\nThe band practiced regularly over the years, and soon became good enough to perform before some young audience, but they never hit the big time unfortunately. The road to success in the music industry is not an easy one to travel, but that does not deter some American dreamers. David's philosophy was \"You never know what the future holds,\" and is engaged in the music industry to this day. A couple of his original band members are also in the industry enjoying marginal success, and are still pursuing their dream.",

On both days banks, schools and the post offices were closed; on both holidays, stores offered special sales; on both holidays, people hung the American Flag, and sometimes there were even fireworks. Laura had seen on television that on both days the President of the United States made a speech and visited a cemetery laying a wreath on the grave of a soldier. Laura decided to ask the mailman Brian what the difference was. She figured he would know since he had both days off from work.\nThe next day when Brian was dropping off Laura's mail, she asked him. Brian explained that Memorial Day is usually observed on the last Monday of May. This meant that it could be on a different date every year. Memorial day is a day for remembering and honoring those in the military who died, especially if they died in a battle. Brian also told Laura that Memorial Day was also considered the unofficial start of summer. Many public beaches would open on Memorial Day. Veterans day is a day set aside to thank and honor all people who served in the United States military. Brian explained that Veterans Day is also to remember those that are still alive. Brian told Laura that the date for Veterans Day never changes. It is always held on November 11, which was the date when World War I ended in 1918.",

Chris was working as a clerk at a clothing manufacturing plant in Commerce, California, which is about three miles from downtown Los Angeles.\nOn that morning she was filing some documents when one of her coworkers came through the door into a large work area that contained about 20 employees. \"The shuttle just blew up,\" he shouted. Most employees were taken aback. They had no idea what he was talking about. Once again he blurted out, \"The space shuttle just blew up in Florida.\" Chris knew at that time something went very wrong.\nThe space shuttle program began in the early 80s, and continued to this day. The fleet consists of various shuttles that are designed to go into space, establish an orbit, and do a variety of tasks. It was heralded as a new era in space exploration. In the past, space exploration vehicles were used once, and then discarded. The shuttle program revolutionized the way space travel was done.\nChris couldn't believe her ears. Soon almost all employees huddled around the lunch room TV set watching in horror the events taking place. It was a sad day for the United States, but it was also the beginning of a new era in space travel. The country rebounded from this disaster and restarted its program after a couple of years. There have been other accidents in the program, and most notably the Columbia, which disintegrated upon reentry in February 2003, but the U.S. will not be deterred.

One of the oldest and most popular board games is Monopoly. It is a game where all players start in the same place, and roll dice to advance from square to square.\nLittle Johnny wanted to join the game one night, and asked his parents if he could play. \"Please, mommy. Please let me play with you tonight,\" he pleaded. His mom thought about it for a while, and said, \"Okay, Johnny. Tonight you can play.\" She really didn't think he was going to be able to play the game, but to her surprise, he was very good at it. The object of the game is to bankrupt your opponents and have most money at the end of the game. You buy properties with money collected by moving around the board. The more money you have in your bank, the more property you can buy.\nJohnny landed on the Boardwalk square, which is a very prized property. It is the most expensive property, but Johnny knew its value and bought it. The square is positioned at the end of the game where everyone collects $200, but if you land on it, you have to pay a high rent. Johnny bought a couple of nearby properties too, and before long, he was collecting rent from all the other players.

From before the time he became a United States citizen, he looked forward to being able to choose who would represent him in the various levels of government. Shortly after taking the citizenship oath, Ken filled out a short paper form, registering him to vote and choosing a political party affiliation. Ken appreciated that choosing a specific political party didn't limit whom he could vote for, though. He was free to vote for someone of the party he registered under. He could even vote for someone of a different party. Since his vote was secret, no one would know anyway.\nNow that he was a naturalized citizen, Ken spent many hours looking over the various voter guides that appeared in his mailbox. On the national level, Ken could vote for president, members of the Congress. On the state level, Ken could vote for state congress people and governor of the state. Locally, Ken could cast a vote for mayor, city council persons, and local school board members.\nHe felt a little overwhelmed by the choices. Besides getting mail about the various candidates, he saw many commercials featuring each candidate's position on various issues. There were also televised debate, which helped show what the candidates have in common and how they differ.\nKen was nervous on the day he went to vote. He went to his local polling place. A poll worker asked for Ken's name and address to verify he was registered. Ken confirmed his registration by signing next to his name. Then he was given a ballot and led to a booth where he had to make some tough choices.",

When Callie asked Jesus about it, he admitted that he was nervous about prom, a dance held at the end of senior year of high school for those graduating. Jesus was feeling a lot of pressure to ask a girl to be his date for the prom. Girls, like Lexi, were also feeling pressure about a guy they liked asking to the prom. A photographer would be on hand to capture on film forever who said yes.\nThen there was the matter of the clothes. Young men like Jesus didn't have to worry so much. Most of them would just rent tuxedos. Young women, like Lexi, however, had to make sure that whatever dress they wore would be unique. There is nothing more embarrassing than going to the prom and having another girl wearing the same dress.\nFor the parents, like Callie, one of the biggest stressor was money. Tickets to the prom cost $120 per student. Renting tuxedos cost a lot of money. Not to mention the fact that traditionally he had to buy his date a corsage. Most students split the cost of a limousine among friends.\nCallie had more than money on her mind, though. She had heard stories about wild things happening on prom night. She worried about Jesus drinking alcohol, even though he was underage.\nCallie encouraged her son not to worry so much about finding a date. Maybe he could go to prom with a group of friends. That was what Jesus ended up doing. It was fine until it was time to be photographed. All of Jesus's friends split up into couples. Jesus posed alone.",

She would use that same shopping cart to take clothes to and from the laundromat, which was only a block away. While Meryl's job was not a block away, the subway station was. Every day she would walk the block to catch a 45-minute underground train ride to work. She repeated the journey in reverse to return home in the evenings.\nAlhambra sure was different, though. The walk from Meryl's house to the supermarket was nearly a mile. She didn't feel like walking that long a distance while pushing shopping cart full of a week's worth of food. The laundromat was a mile in the other direction. She wasn't going to push her dirty clothes through that many streets. There were no trains nearby to take her to work, just buses. The buses always took a long time to come. For the first few weeks, Meryl was always late everywhere. Sometimes when she had an urgent appointment, Meryl would ask friends to give her a ride somewhere. Almost all of her friends had cars and knew how to drive.

Baseball seemed like the perfect sport for Johnny to learn to play since it is nicknamed America's Pastime.\nEmma took her son to the tryouts after school. \"I'm sorry,\" one of the coaches told Emma. \"Johnny was too young to try out for baseball.

Emma couldn't imagine her son standing still for nine minutes.\nT-ball sounded like a good way to introduce her son to the responsibilities of being on a sports team and the rules of baseball. Emma had to bring Johnny back on a different day to try out for T-ball. When she did, he was put on a team. After paying a fee, Johnny was given a uniform. Johnny looked at the back of his uniform. \"Hey, look! Mom. I'm number one!\" he said proudly.\nOnce Johnny started playing though, it was clear to Emma that he was not very good at baseball. He stuck with it though, and his team ended the season in fourth place. There were only four teams in the T-ball league. \"Can I play again next season,\" Johnny asked his mom. \"Yes, but see if you can get another number,\" she told him.",

She had terrible acne that covered her face from ear to ear. It made her very self-conscious so she didn't go out on dates very much, but that all changed when she met Josh. They were together for more than 10 years until, sadly, they went their separate ways. Since then, Helen has nurtured and tended her garden as if it were her child.\nWhen I got home later that day, she was outside working on her roses. I said hello to her as I walked to my door, and she smiled brightly. She looked beautiful.",

The market is in the neighborhood, and it is not one of the giant, national, big-name stores. It is a small store with only a few locations around Los Angeles. Alex likes these types of markets so much better than the super stores because there are real people running them.\nAlex knows the guy that runs the fruits and vegetables section at the market. His name is Diego, who was born in Tijuana, Mexico, about 120 miles from Los Angeles. Diego always lets Alex know what is a good buy at the market. \"Hola Diego,\" Alex said in Spanish. \"Hey Alex, how are you,\" he answered in English. This happens every time Alex talks to Diego. Alex speaks to him in Spanish, and Diego answers in English.\nSpanish is spoken a lot around L.A. The city has the largest population of Mexicans anywhere in the world, except Mexico City. Alex likes to show Diego how much Spanish he knows, and Diego also wanted Alex to know how much English he knows. It's so funny to hear a conversation like this. They sometimes get strange looks from people.\nToday, Diego got some beautiful oranges. They were big and plump, and were at the right price, too. \"These are great, Alex. You will like them very much,\" said Diego. Alex responded with \"Muy bueno, Diego,\" which means \"Very good, Diego.\" He also told Alex about some tasty cucumbers they had today, and Alex ended up buying a few of those too. When Alex left, he said, \"Buenas tardes, Diego,\" which is a Mexican farewell phrase, and Diego said, \"See you soon, my friend.\"",

Dennis was the only boy that went to a private school, and his friends would often tease him about it. \"You're not one of us! You're not one of us,\" they would sometimes chant. He wasn't really alone, though. His friend Patricia also went to the Catholic school, but she was a girl. After a while, they began walking to the small school together every morning. Pat was the first girl friend Dennis had ever had. She wasn't his girlfriend. She was just a friend who happened to be a girl.\nThe nuns at the school were very mean. They ruled the school like it was a prison. Dennis was afraid to even raise his hand to ask a question. His mother was often called into meetings with the principal about Dennis, who would also sit in the office listening to the principal telling his mother how smart he was, but was very lazy. Needless to say, Dennis didn't do well in school and ended up going to a junior college after high school. He didn't do very well there either, and soon dropped out.\nThat all changed after Dennis grew up and started working. He had worked for many years before deciding he wanted to earn a degree after all. Dennis went back to school at the age of 30, and soon was a college graduate with a degree. It turned out Dennis wasn't as lazy as those nuns thought he was.",

You are not anyone in Los Angeles if you don't have a car, or at least that is what some people say.\nBefore that, Mario had never owned or bought a car in his life. His father warned him about the sales people. \"Don't ever pay the asking price, son,\" he said. Mario looked at him with disbelief. \"What do you take me for, dad? I am not an idiot. I know not to pay the first offer,\" he screamed back. His dad offered to go with him to the car dealer, but Mario wanted to go alone. It was his money and his car, and he was determined to do this alone.\nWhen Mario got to the car dealer, a nice man came up to him and asked if he wanted to take the car he was looking at for a test drive. Mario said, \"Yes, of course.\" So they went for a drive. Mario fell in love with the car and the salesman knew immediately that he was going to make some money. It turns out that you should never let a salesman know you're interested in anything you want to purchase. Mario didn't know how to negotiate and wound up paying too much for the car. He really didn't care, though. He owned his first car. When he told his dad what he paid for it, he thought his dad was going to be mad, but he just said, \"That's okay, son.

Nimisha usually stayed in the living room when her mother was working with another student.\nOne afternoon though, Nimisha felt so thirsty. She had to get into the kitchen to get a drink. \"Mom, can I please have a drink?\" Nimisha asked. Amisa was annoyed. She was in the middle of a lesson. \"Yes, but you have to serve yourself because I'm working,\" Amisa said. Nimisha pulled a stepstool up to the kitchen cabinet and stood on it. She opened the kitchen cabinet and reached up to the top shelf to get a blue plastic cup. Then she slipped. Nimesha let out a huge scream. When Amisa got up to see what was wrong, she saw that her daughter's hand had slipped and the tongs of a large serving fork had gone through Nimisha's finger. Nimisha was crying. Amisa was scared. She had her client go home early, and was going to rush her daughter to the hospital. She didn't want to try and pull the fork out herself because she was worried that she might make the situation worse.\nNimisha lived four blocks from the hospital. She felt it was faster to walk to the hospital than call and wait for an ambulance. There was only one problem. It was very cold outside, and Amisa couldn't put a coat on her daughter when she had a huge serving fork protruding from one of her fingers. Amisa wrapped a blanket around her child and together they quickly walked to the hospital.\n\"My daughter has a fork stuck in her finger!\" Amisa yelled as she entered the emergency room.",

From a small seed in the soil, she grew flowers and herbs. This season, though, was a bust.\nShe began to do some research on the Internet on drought-resistant plants, which are plants that would do alright in full sun and without regular water. It turned out there were quite a few plants that were drought-resistant. Through her Internet search, Hannah even found a website for a place that was selling native plants, which were grown naturally from her climate.\nHannah laughed at the name though. It was called a nursery. Hannah always thought a nursery was a bedroom for a new-born baby or a very young child, not a place to buy plants. The more she thought about it though, the more it made sense. Going to a nursery was like going to get a baby. Except in this case, the baby was a plant she would bring home.\nHannah drove 30 minutes to get to the nursery, which had a whole section of drought-resistant plants. She walked up and down the outdoor aisles, carefully considering her options. Then she stopped in front of a small seedling that was just flowering. \"I found my baby,\" she thought.",

In addition, the class had two teacher's assistants to help the classroom teacher.\nThe special education school also scheduled speech therapy sessions for Jessica. Once a day a specialist would come in and work with Jessica to help her practice learning how to move her mouth and tongue and ask for what she needed and wanted. An occupational therapist helped Jessica learn to feed herself and other age appropriate self-sufficiency skills.

When my mom went into the hospital, my dad was excited and jumping up and down, but after my mom had the baby, my dad came out with a confused look on his face. I asked him what was wrong, if the baby was okay. He looked at me and said yes, but that the baby was actually a girl. My grandma looked at him, and smacked him in the head. She said, \"That's wonderful news. Don't look so depressed!\"\nMy dad laughed and said \"No, I'm not depressed, I'm just confused.\" For the first three months of her life, my sister looked like a boy. She wore nothing but boy's clothes, because that's all my parents had gotten for her. I took a lot of pictures, so I could tell her later that she was actually a boy, but an accident happened that changed her into a girl. My mom deleted all my photos because it was mean.\nI'll never forget the look on my dad's face when he came out of the delivery room. He looked like he was trying to solve a big math problem in his head. It was like he was trying to count from one to a million, luckily my grandma slapped it out of him.",

Gabriel said yes.\nWhen Gabriel showed up, he saw a giant Easter bunny walking around the restaurant. He started chuckling to himself. He had always wanted to wear a costume, and walk around talking to people. As people started showing up, he noticed that the Easter bunny wasn't coming out to greet the people. Gabriel had a job to do though. He started cleaning the tables he was assigned; when he finished, he went to take his break.\nWhile he was eating, Jackie went up to Gabriel and said \"I think we need you to take over as the Easter bunny, would you be willing to do that?\" Gabriel said of course, because he didn't want to let down the boss, but also because he secretly wanted to do it. As he walked out fully dressed like the Easter Bunny, he saw children lining up to take pictures with him. He walked over and took pictures with everyone that was in line.\nThere was a little train for the children outside in the garden. After he took the pictures, he decided to go on the train and ride it with the children. The children were asking him if he was the real Easter Bunny, and if he had been to Disneyland, Gabriel nodded his head. After he got off the train, he walked around the restaurant and started dancing in the restaurant. People started to applaud as they ate. It was the first time Gabriel ever dressed up as the Easter Bunny, but he loved every second of it.",

He finally got the courage to talk to her one April day.\nThe school was right on a busy street, so a crossing guard helped students cross to the other side. The guard carried a sign  over his head that said \"Stop\" so that cars would not hit anyone. The rule was that no one could cross the street without the guard, so everyone always waited. One day Josh got to the corner and the crossing guard was gone, so he decided to cross the street alone. That's when he heard \"Hey! You're not supposed to cross the street alone!\" It was the crossing guard. Josh didn't see him because the guard was behind a bush tying his shoes. Josh was so scared. From that day on, he decided to go all the way around the block to avoid seeing the guard. He knew the guard would report him to the school.\nWhat happened next was something he could not believe. It turned out Diana went around the block too, but Josh didn't know that then. He accidentally ran into her one day and they started to talk.

All you needed was a little imagination and a sense of adventure.\nThe way the game is played is simple. I remember the first time I played. I came up to some of my brother's friends who were playing in the neighborhood. \"Hey, what are you guys playing?\" I asked. \"We are playing Hide and Seek,\" said Robert, my brother's best friend. \"Can I play?\" I asked, even though I didn't really know the rules. After a while, the boys let me play. The object of the game is to hide from one of the players. This person closes his eyes and counts to 10 out loud to start the game.  While he or she is counting, the rest of the kids run to find a hiding place.\nHiding places can be anywhere. Behind cars, or in the bushes, just about anywhere! It was Robert's turn. When he had counted 10, he yelled, \"Ready or not, here I come!\" Whoever is the first person found becomes \"It\", and it's their turn to count. I thought I had the best hiding place ever. I was in the bushes near my house. I could see through the leaves everything Robert was doing, and I knew he was getting close to finding David, another one of my friends.\nI was overjoyed that I wasn't going to be the first one found. I had proven myself to everybody who said I was too young to play when all of a sudden, a mouse ran over my foot! I jumped and screamed out of the bushes, and was the first one found.

I remember the first time I went to a drive-in. I was 18 years old and was dating my future wife Caroline. We went on a double-date with my best friend Alfred and his girl Jeannie. The drive-in we visited that night was called the Starlight. It was close to home, and it had the best sound system of all the drive-ins. It also had a huge screen. We went to see \"Forrest Gump\" that night, mainly because Carol wanted to see it. \"I heard it is a great movie,\" she said. I really didn't know anything about the movie, but I did want to see something.\n\"Forrest Gump\" was indeed one of the best movies ever made. It had everything -- humor, drama, tragedy, and triumph. It is a great film. Watching it that night under the stars with Carol on my arm was the greatest night. \"I tell you babe, I was wrong about this movie. I really liked it,\" I said. She just smiled and gave me a hug. Alfred and Jeannie were busy kissing in the back seat, which is another advantage of going to a drive-in.\nThose old drive-ins were around for decades, but soon after \"Forrest Gump\" came out, many of them started closing. They closed because of the new multiplex theaters popping up all over the country. People had a choice of many films to watch at those theaters, and soon the drive-in was gone. In Los Angeles, there is only one remaining drive-in I know of -- the Vineland. There might be more, but I don't know where. It is sad to see them go, but the memories are still with me.",

It was a perfect night for a ball game. The temperature was in the low 70s, and it was a clear, breezy night.\nThe Dodgers were playing the Giants that night. The two teams have been playing each other for about 100 years, ever since both teams were in New York. The Giants moved the same year the Dodgers did. only they moved up north to San Francisco. That didn't stop the rivalry though. The teams hate each other today as much as they did back in New York. The best part of the night was that the Dodgers won, so I had a couple of Dodger Dogs. \"I don't know what they do to these hot dogs, but they are delicious,\" I told Josie.

It precedes \"All Hallows Day\", which is a day to honor dead relatives.

Of course that was an exaggeration, but it turned out we were pretty good for a bunch of novices.\nThe three of us began meeting at my place every week to practice playing together and to bounce song ideas off each other. Bobby could actually sing. With Rudy and me putting in all those hours of practice, we got pretty good. We got so good that we played at a couple of parties and at a free Concert in the Park festival about a year later. That was as far as we got though. Rudy joined the Army the following year.

That's exactly what he did the following day. Andrew asked some of his friends if they would like to learn Spanish with him at the community college. \"No, thank you,\" most of them said. Andrew's friends thought it would be too hard to learn Spanish. Little did his friends know, Spanish wasn't that hard to learn. Andrew had learned this firsthand.",

His life's work was to bring South Africa into mainstream 20th Century thinking by ending Apartheid.\nApartheid was a system of South African government that was based on racial segregation between the minority white population and black South Africans. It was a controversial form of government that was in effect from 1948 to 1994, and caused great social turmoil. The system was put into place following World War II, but racial segregation began much earlier in the country. Apartheid separated South Africans by race by placing people into four classifications: white, black, coloured, and Indian. Each group had different levels of privilege, with white South Africans being the most favored.\nFrom 1960 to 1983, 3.5 million black South Africans were forcibly removed from their homes; in 1970, all non-white politicians were removed from government. Mandela's move to end Apartheid began in 1949 when he supported, and organized non-violent boycotts, strikes, and civil disobedience. He was arrested, and charged with treason in 1956 for his role in the social uprising, and was eventually jailed for 27 years. During this time, most of the countries in the world called for his release, and placed trade embargos against the white regime.\nThe country finally gave in to international pressure, and released Mandela.

In the United States, Darwin has become the symbol for atheists in the country as his theory of evolution smacks in the face of creationism. His theory claims that all of earth's species have descended from their ancestors, and that they have adapted to their surroundings throughout history. It also claims that every species has a common ancestor. Darwin introduced his theory in his landmark book On the Origin of Species in 1859.\nHis book was met with suspicion from both the scientific community and the general public, but by the 1870s, his work was beginning to gain mass acceptance. One of his most significant studies came when he sailed with the HMS Beagle, a British sea vessel, to the Galapagos Islands. The islands have been long isolated from the South American mainland, and provided him with a unique insight on the process of evolution.\nWhile sailing from island to island, Darwin noticed similarities between island species and mainland species. Most were similar in many ways, but some had subtle differences. He also found that the same species had differences from island to island. To Darwin it was clear that the reason for the slight differences was the individual environment of each island. These islands showed Darwin the evolution process in the making.\nDarwin has many critics from religious circles. A very famous caricature of Darwin depicting him as a half-human monkey was published in 1871 in response to his theory that humans evolved from ape-like creatures. He spawned a movement of non-believers called Darwinism, which includes people who feel his theories are rooted in the scientific method as opposed to religious dogma.",

The ship was on its maiden voyage on that night when it struck an iceberg in the deep waters of the North Atlantic Ocean. The ship was in route to New York City from Southampton, UK when it hit the iceberg, killing more than 1,500 of the 2,224 passengers. The ship was the largest ship ever built to that date, and was thought to be unsinkable.\nThe ship's passengers varied from some of the richest people in the world at the time, to thousands of immigrant workers who were trying to find work in the United States. The Titanic was equipped with technological safety features like remote control watertight doors, and watertight compartments, but it did not carry enough lifeboats for all passengers. Because of the immense size of the ship, it was thought to be unsinkable, a fact that contributed to the small number of lifeboats carried on the ship. Additionally, many of the lifeboats were not filled to capacity when they were launched, causing more loss of life.\nMost of those killed that night were men. The protocol followed by the ship's officers required \"women and children first,\" when loading lifeboats. The accident was met by international shock and grief. Many of today's maritime rules were put into place because of this disaster. Only 705 passengers floating on lifeboats were saved that night. The ship broke into two parts before it went under. It remains more than a mile deep in the North Atlantic. The sinking of the Titanic has been documented in film and literature over the years.",

She had gotten the news of her acceptance two months ago, but had spent all that time so busy preparing for the move that she hadn't had time to realize how nervous she really was. It wasn't until it was time for her to get up from the plane seat that she realized her legs were shaking, her heart was racing, and her forehead was sweating.\n\"Keep calm!\" she kept repeating to herself the whole way to her new apartment. She had worked so hard to get here, and she knew that she had nothing to be afraid of. Still, as she looked out of her new living-room window, the world outside looked much too scary to face. Having grown up on the West Coast her whole life, she was not prepared for how everything looked here. The warm, bright sun that she was so used to seeing out this time of year was nowhere to be seen. Everyone's accents seemed completely unfamiliar, and the people even seemed taller than normal.\nShe decided to stay in the safety of her apartment that night and didn't go outside until it was time for her class the following afternoon. As the professor asked some basic questions to see what level everyone was at, Andrea's mind went completely blank. \"Oh no!\" she thought to herself. \"I'm not even supposed to be here! Everyone knows so much more than me.\" Just then, the professor pointed at her and asked her a question about the functions of the spinal cord. As frightened as she was, the answer was just blurted out of her mouth instinctively. \"Impressive!\" says the teacher. \"You'll do just great here.\" she assured her. As the teacher walked away, one of the pesky giant ants crawled across Andrea's desk. She quickly flicked it off the edge, and then smiled confidently.",

However, for Marek, booking his dentist appointment ended up being one of the worst mistakes in his life. This was because of the fact that the dentist Marek chose to visit was his ex-girlfriend whom he had recently broken up with to be with another woman. This silly mistake resulted in Marek walking out of the dentist's office with all the 32 teeth missing.\n\"I didn't have any reason to doubt her,\" says Marek. \"I mean I thought she was a professional.\" Quite on the contrary, his ex-girlfriend decided that this was the perfect chance to get her revenge for having been heart-broken. She gave him a heavy dose of anesthesia, pulled out all of his teeth, and bandaged his whole face up with gauze so that her work wouldn't be noticed until the bandages were all pulled off. \"The bandages are to protect your gums,\" she told Marek, who then left the office, still heavily numbed by the effects of the anesthesia.\nAs the anesthesia wore off on his way home, he could tell something was terribly wrong because he couldn't feel any teeth. One can only imagine the panic he must have felt after uncovering his ex's work under all the gauze. After reporting the event to the police, his ex is now facing the possibility of three years in prison for a doctor's malpractice suit. On the bright side for her, she might be spending those three years behind bars pleased at knowing that her shocking stunt was very effective in terms of getting even with Marek. After seeing that he no longer had any teeth, his new girlfriend broke up with him.",

However, her road to richness was not all completely smooth. Her story reminds us that in order to win the lottery, there are two crucial requirements. The first and most obvious necessity is a lot of luck. The second requirement is just as important, but much less often mentioned -- getting organized.\nAstrid's story began when getting in line for a lottery ticket at her local supermarket. The woman ahead of her decided to let her cut in front of her to pay. This woman was also planning on buying a lottery ticket. Had she not given Astrid her spot in the line, the lottery money  would have been hers!\nOn the day that the winners were announced, Astrid realized she had won, she could not contain her excitement. She danced with joy all around her house and jumped on the phone to tell her closest relatives what had just happened. The next morning Astrid woke up and prepared to go claim her prize money, but suddenly realized that she could not remember where she had placed her ticket. Given that her memory was no longer as sharp as it used to be, she searched and searched around her messy house for hours to no avail. She had absolutely no recollection of where she might have stored or dropped the ticket.\nAstrid had been given thirty days to claim her prize, or else it would be canceled. For 27 days, her schedule was dedicated to searching every surface and square foot of her house for the missing ticket. With only three days left, she decided to finally call her daughters for help. She had been too embarrassed to call them from the beginning because her house was so messy, but now had no other choice.  Figuring that helping their mother find the ticket would probably secure at least an extra million dollars to them, all three of Astrid's daughters immediately sped over to her house.\nWithin the first half hour of searching, the youngest of her daughters hollered, \"I found it!\" It turned out Astrid had left it in a dish cabinet. \"Oh, thank you, daughter!\" Astrid cried. \"I owe you so much!\" Her daughter's smile glistened with pride as her two sisters scowled at her from the next room.",

Sadly, this is not the case for Michael, a part-time student that works late nights as a warehouse manager. Michael gets home around 2:00 a.m. every night, and heads straight to bed to get as much sleep as possible until his classes start at 10:00 a.m. However, for the past week, Michael has had a new \"alarm clock\" that he unfortunately has no control of. It is an energetic, loud, mockingbird that has decided to make the tree outside of Michael's window his new home.\nEach morning, the bird begins singing as loud as possible at exactly 5:55 a.m. and does not stop until late into the night. Most city birds begin the day with sweet, gentle chirps that can barely even be heard indoors, but the sounds of mockingbirds are very distinct and consist of various noises that the mockingbird hears and then imitates. This can include chirps from other birds, or even car alarms and school bells.\nAfter one week of losing sleep as a result of the bird noises, Michael decided to do something. \"Go away!\" he screamed out his window. When that didn't work, he started throwing things at the tree to try to scare the bird away. This only made the bird get even louder! As a final resort, Michael phoned his local Animal Control, and requested to get someone to remove the bird from the area. \"We can't do that,\" replied the Animal Control Specialist. \"Mockingbirds are a valued feature of North America's wildlife and are protected by many laws. You should consider yourself lucky to have one so close to home. Just enjoy the beautiful sounds of nature.\"\nFurious, Michael hung up the phone, and threw himself on the couch, dozing off into the deepest sleep he had ever experienced all week. Only five minutes later he awoke to a thunderous \"caw-caw!\" coming from outside.",

This massive earthquake, which is the third strongest ever recorded in history, triggered various powerful tsunamis that reached over a dozen countries' shores. Nearly 230,000 people were killed by the catastrophe, and hundreds of thousands of others ended up injured or missing. In the midst of all the devastation caused by this disaster, many amazing and inspiring survival stories have emerged. One of the most extraordinary of these is the story of a young girl named Wati.\nThe tsunami struck her hometown of Aceh when she was only eight years old. Like so many others, the powerful waves separated her from her family, and she ended up being washed into an unknown town. After many years of searching for her, her family gave up and assumed she had died after being swept away. Miraculously, Wati was returned to her parents seven years later, at the age of 15!\nAccording to Wati, she had been \"adopted\" by a stranger who found her on the streets after the tsunami. Although the woman took her in to live with her, she forced Wati to beg on the streets and would often beat her if she did not make enough money. The girl had tried to find her family by asking for help from strangers, but did not remember the names of her parents and could only vaguely remember that she had a grandfather named Ibraham.\nFinally one day, a cab driver who heard Wati's story happened to know an old man with that name in a nearby town and decided to take her to him. Although the old man did not recognize her at first, he took Wati to see his daughter. \"When I saw my mother, I knew it was her,\" said the 15-year-old. \"I just knew.\" The parents were able to confirm that it really was their daughter based on a scar and birthmark on the girl's hip. This miraculous story is unfortunately one of the only confirmed reunions among families that were separated by the disaster.",

She had spent the previous night in front of her television set watching a reality show that followed lucky people who had found amazing things at their local thrift shops. All of these people had bought seemingly ordinary items for extremely low prices, and ended up discovering that their items were actually very valuable treasures. After having spent five consecutive hours watching other people's experiences, Mary was determined to give bargain hunting a try in hopes of finding something that would make her rich.\nOne of her favorite stories from the show was of a man who had purchased a copy of the Declaration of Independence thinking that it was a cheap replica, for only $2. He ended up discovering that the print was actually one of only 200 official copies of the Declaration of Independence commissioned by John Quincy Adams in 1820. The man ended up making $477,650 after selling it.\nAs Mary walked into her local thrift shop, she tried recalling what all the people in the reality show had looked for. The most common items that people got rich from were paintings and so she headed straight to the Home Decorations aisle. Once there, she couldn't decide which looked most expensive. They actually all seemed pretty ugly to her. \"Excuse me,\" Mary said to an elderly woman walking by. \"Which painting do you think could make me richer?\" Confused, the old lady quickly pointed at one and walked away.\nThe painting the old lady had pointed at was of a cat collage with almost 20 different cat faces jumbled atop of one another. \"Definitely not my first choice,\" thought Mary. However, she trusted destiny's decision and bought the painting for five dollars. After putting it up online, she began receiving dozens of emails asking if the picture frame displayed came with the painting. In order to see what all the buzz about the frame was about, she took it to an antique store and asked if there was anything special about the frame. \"Of course, it is special!\" remarked the clerk at the store. \"Its wood and age make it at least $25,000!\" Mary ended up selling the frame for $30,000. A few days later, the buyer returned the ugly painting to her through the mail.",

He had already gotten three phone numbers from the girls he was trying to impress.\nI always love Joe coming over to my house, because it makes my day more exciting. After he showed me his arm, Joe asked me if I wanted to go to the mall. \"Sure, why not?\" I said. I asked my mom for permission, and she said yes.\nWhen we got to the mall, Joe wanted to get something to eat, so we went to McDonald's. We got two hamburgers and two sodas, and then we went walking around the mall. For some reason, Joe always liked stealing things from the stores at the mall. I never understood why he stole the things he did. For example, that day he stole three key chains, five pairs of socks, and a t-shirt of a television show that he had never heard of. Joe always said the same thing when he got out of the store, \"I love the rush of stealing!\" I always looked at him, shook my head, and called him an idiot.\nThe worst was yet to come. When we were leaving the mall to go catch the bus, a security guard grabbed Joe and me by the shoulders and told us we couldn't leave. The security guard took us to his office, and called our parents. I was worried because I knew my dad would yell at me. Joe, on the other hand, was laughing and was telling me jokes. When our parents showed up to pick us up, Joe looked at me, smiling, and said, \"See you in a couple of months.\" I looked at him, shook my head, and called him an idiot.",

Mark thought this was a good thing since he knew many people were looking for work. Another set of flyers included coupons to be used on opening day. The store had many bargains for common items like paper towels, but also for big screen televisions. Mark thought this too was a good thing. It seemed like a good idea to be able to get a variety of things in one place instead of going from one store to another. It would save time and money. Superstores could sell groceries and clothes under one roof.\nAnother set of flyers contradicted the positive messages about the superstore though.

That was when I realized that he was asleep. I couldn't believe it. This was an important event in my life, an event that I had been worried about for months. When we finished, he woke up and told me I had done a good job, and that I would be getting my license in about a month. I laughed, and thanked him. I went to tell my dad the good news.",

The musician saw this and told the waiter to leave him alone and that he would like to buy the homeless man something to eat. The waiter looked at the musician and said okay. The homeless man thanked the musician. After he finished eating, he took out the ten-dollar bill and gave it to the musician. The homeless man left.\nAfter the musician had finished playing at the cafe, he decided to go to a local art festival with his girlfriend. As they were walking around and looking at all the different paintings and sculptures, the musician's girlfriend saw a sculpture she liked.

He pulled out ten dollars, and gave it to the artist. As the musician and his girlfriend walked away, the artist looked at the ten-dollar bill, and smiled. \"Well, look at that, you found your way back home,\" said the artist.",

Julie ran upstairs to her apartment and told her mom about the pigeon.\n\"We have to help it!\" Julie insisted. Julie's mom made a disgusted face. \"I don't want to. Pigeons have diseases,\" she said. Julie began to cry. This made Julie's mom feel bad. She gave in, but she gave Julie some rules. The pigeon had to stay in the kitchen in a storage bin. Julie's mom didn't want to have to touch the dirty bird.\nJulie put one of her old baby blankets on the bottom of a deep storage bin. While Julie tried to feed the injured bird bits of moist bread, Julie's mom looked online for local animal rescue organizations. She felt silly trying to save a pigeon though. Finally she found an organization that would take the bird, but not until the next morning. Julie stayed up all night watching the bird.\nThe next morning Julia and her mother took the subway to the bird rescue organization. Many people on the train gave Julie and her mother strange looks. Julie's mother just shrugged. When they got to the rescue organization, Julie told the worker, \"Please take good care of Sebastian\".",

Then nearly every house between her house and the laundromat had a big dog that barked at her. Elizabeth hated big scary dogs.",

While the house flippers put in new stainless steel appliances in the kitchen, they hadn't upgraded the electrical work. This meant that every time Bob ran the dishwasher and the coffee machine, all the power in the house went out. Bob spent over $1,000 dollars to have the house rewired. The new carpets that the house flippers installed was put over the original hardwood floors. Bob decided to rip out the ugly oatmeal colored carpets and refinish the old floors. That was another $3,000.\nThe house was an old stucco house that got very hot in the summer and cold in the winter. The house flippers installed some cheap windows. Bob hired a contractor to put in new double pane storm windows and install ceiling fans. That was another few thousand dollars. Bob wanted to make the house energy efficient, so he leased solar panels that were installed on the roof. This not only lowered his monthly electric bill, but added value to the home.\nWithin two years, all the changes Bob made to the house totaled more than $20,000. In that time the value of his home rose almost $100,000. Bob felt he made a good investment. He knew when he sold the home, he would get more money than he paid.",

Last year, I got a DUI, which means Driving Under the Influence. If you get pulled over and you smell like alcohol, the police will ask you to take a breathalyzer test. When you do the test, you have to blow really hard into a machine, which will then tell you if you are over the limit to drive a vehicle. The limit is usually .08 blood alcohol volume. So, if you pass that, you are going to jail.\nEven though you won't go to jail for a long time, you will be suffering the consequences of your mistake for a long time. Here is a list of the things  you will have to do if you get a DUI: go to court, go to alcohol education classes, go to Alcoholics Anonymous, pay a lot of money in fines. If you don't want to pay, you will have to do community service. I got my DUI almost two year ago, and I am still suffering the consequences. I still have 56 hours for community service.\nI have to update my insurance policy, and deal with the Department of Motor Vehicles. You waste a lot of time and money. It gets difficult to get a job, because you have to let your future employer know that you have been arrested. It's not worth it. If you are thinking about going out to celebrate and party with friends and family, do one of the following: get a designated driver, take the bus or train, or call a cab. It may cost you a little bit of money, but compared to how much money you will lose if you get a DUI, it's nothing. Don't drink and drive.",

People can go swimming, rent a bike, play volleyball, or shop around. Kenneth is always careful when he is around volleyball nets and people bicycling. Last year, he was walking by the volleyball nets when a large man jumped up to hit the ball, which ended up hitting Kenneth right in the head. The man ran to Kenneth to make sure he was okay.

She looked like she saw a ghost. Donna grabbed Jennifer and told her to go outside. Jennifer and Sarah never got along. It might have something to do with me, but I'm not sure.\nJennifer hadn't seen Sarah, because Donna took Jennifer outside before she had the chance. I took Sarah by the hand, and asked her who had invited her. She looked at me confused, because apparently I had invited her through a text message a week ago. It was true. I invited her, but I never thought she would show up. When Jennifer finally came into the room, she saw Sarah and became very angry. She looked at me and started yelling at me. \"Why is she here, Jason?\" asked Jennifer. I looked at her equally angry and said, \"What are you talking about? What are YOU doing here?\" Jennifer started yelling at Sarah, and Sarah started yelling at Jennifer. They got so angry that they started fighting, which eventually got us kicked out of the restaurant. My mother was crushed when she got there. Donna got grounded for a month.

It was not that I didn't like anyone or that no one liked me. It was that my parents had a rule. They had to approve of whoever I would be dating. Sometimes I thought they had that rule specifically to embarrass me.\nI hate that I can't have normal parents. They are weird. They like collecting old books, and watching old movies. They listen to old records on an old record player. They say that it's better than listening to an iPod. I always let them know that at least I can listen to my iPod when I go out. The last day of high school had passed, and I didn't know what I wanted to do. I decided to take a year off and work. My parents didn't like it, but it was my decision to make.\nI got a job at a little restaurant called \"Baker's Cabin\". It was a nice restaurant where people could sit down and have a good steak dinner at a reasonable price. I liked working there. However, what I liked most was the bartender Paul. He had barely turned 21, and was already working behind the bar. We started talking. I think he really likes me, but I don't want things to get awkward  when he meets my parents. One day, my friend Susan told Paul that the only way he could date me was to meet my parents. Paul went over that night with some records his dad had given him, and offered them to my parents. They went nuts, and invited him in. They started asking him questions, but not about his sex life or religious beliefs. The questions were all about music. They really liked him, and they were actually acting normal. I think Paul is the guy for me.",

A Puerto Rican friend held a salsa dancing party in her house. Before then Mary always just thought salsa was something you ate on tacos or with nachos. She had no idea it was also the name of a dance style. One dance style that Mary had yet to try was tango from Argentina.\nTango seemed so complicated to Mary. The footwork was very intricate. She imagined she would end up stepping on her partner's feet. Mary hadn't had a tango partner yet. She didn't have a dance partner in general. In classes, instructors always paired her up with fellow classmates. At dance clubs it was easy to find a dance partner. Tango classes were expensive though. Mary didn't even think there were any tango clubs.\nOne day Mary received an email from a friend with information about a tango night outside the city's music center. Musicians would be playing tango music and instructors would teach the basic steps. The best of all, the event was free and no partner was required.\nOn the night of the tango event, Mary wore her high-heeled dancing shoes. There was a wooden dance floor in the middle of the music center plaza. A group of musicians played on a small stage in front of the dance floor. \"May I have this dance?\" a man asked Mary when she arrived. He wore a sticker with the words \"dance instructor\" on it.

Robert was really happy because he didn't have to leave his dog behind, and his best animal friend could be with him all the time.

Washington was also the Commander-in-Chief of the First Continental Army that fought the British when the country was not yet established.\nHis epic \"Crossing of the Delaware\" river to recover New York City is still considered one of the greatest military moves in the history of warfare. At the time of the crossing, the British had taken Boston and New York. The Continental Army was on the run and disorganized, but Washington had a plan. He decided to take his troops across the Delaware River in the middle of winter. This was a move that many military minds thought impossible, but not Washington. The Americans were able to take New Jersey, and change the course of the war.\nAnother landmark moment for Washington was the winter at Valley Forge. In 1777, Washington led an army of more than 11,000 troops into Valley Forge in Pennsylvania, where the army suffered through a cold winter that claimed the lives of 3,000 men. When the spring arrived, instead of a demoralized, beaten group of soldiers, the army emerged battle ready, and able to continue the fight against the English in New York. The army was able to survive the fierce winter because of the training, and preparedness of Washington's officers. Washington earned the nickname, \"The Father of His Country,\" because of his military intelligence that led to the birth of the nation.",

German automaker, Karl Benz, is credited with inventing the first motor vehicle in the late 1880s, but Ford was the man who made it possible for everyday citizens to own one. Before Ford came up with his assembly line process, cars were built one at a time by hand, which was a very costly and inefficient method of production. Ford's assembly line revolutionized the way cars were built, and his methods are still in use today.\nIn 1886, Benz patented his Motorwagen, which was a four-wheel, two-passenger, self-powered motor coach that was designed to replace the horse and carriage. These vehicles were expertly crafted, but were available to only the wealthiest people of the time. Thanks to Ford, that all changed in 1906. His Ford Motor Company, the first automobile company to use assembly line techniques to build cars. transformed the automobile from an expensive curiosity to a practical tool that could be used to transport people and goods easily and efficiently. His first mass-produced product was the Model T. It remains one of the most sold vehicles ever, and was the first to reach 15 million sales.\nFord's impact on the 20th Century cannot be overstated. At one time it was estimated that nine out of 10 vehicles on American roads were Fords. His cars spurred the American economy like no other single factor. The country's roadways were built in response to the great number of vehicles Ford and subsequent American automakers produced. Additionally, Ford's vehicles created a network of support industries such as parts, repair, and maintenance services. It also caused a revolution in how goods were transported in the country.

King was born Michael King, but his father changed his name in honor of the German reformer, Martin Luther.\nKing lived during the most divisive era in American history. The white and the southern culture in the United States wanted nothing to do with social change during the 60s. Segregation laws were in place that prohibited black Americans from eating at the same restaurants as whites, or to ride in the same section on public buses with white Americans. King led the famous 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott in reaction to Rosa Park's refusal to surrender her bus seat to a white passenger as was required by law in Montgomery, Alabama at the time.\nKing started his activism while serving as a Baptist minister for the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church. He believed strongly in the Christian belief that loving thy neighbor as yourself, which was a philosophy he used throughout his civil rights years.  He was also a great speaker. His \"I Have a Dream\" speech is regarded as one of the most famous oratory in American history. In it, he speaks of how his dream is for white and black Americans to walk together hand in hand as brothers. The speech also declared how it was his dream for all Americans to be judged, not by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.\nOn October 14, 1964, King was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his involvement in combating racial inequality in the United States.

He almost single-handedly invented the home run, which is baseball's most cherished feat. Before Ruth, the home run was a novelty. It was a game of strategy, but the Babe changed all that.\nRuth was born in a rough section of Baltimore, Maryland in 1895. Much of his childhood has been lost to history. He spent a number of years at St. Mary's reformatory school after being labeled as \"incorrigible.\" His behavior was thought to be beyond rehabilitation. When exactly he got his start in baseball is also a mystery. Some accounts offer that he was placed on St. Mary's baseball team by the coach of the time. One popular story has Ruth being sent to the school because of his natural ability to hit a baseball. The story is that Ruth broke many windows while playing baseball on the streets, and that is why he was sent to the school in the first place.\nBefore the 1920s, baseball was a slow game that included advancing players around the bases by strategically hitting the ball within the park. Ruth came in and was soon hitting balls out of the ballpark to the delight of the fans in attendance. The home run became an integral part of the game. Ruth earned several nicknames because of his power, including the \"Bambino,\" and the \"Sultan of Swat.\"\nWhen Ruth was traded by the Red Sox to the Yankees in a very unpopular move, the Yankees won seven World Series championships in his 12 years. Ruth made headlines for his after-hours antics in New York City as well. His drinking, and womanizing are well-documented.

Segregation laws were still in effect in many parts of the country, and Owens felt this prejudice directly.

He has directed such blockbusters as E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Jurassic Park, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Schindler's List, and Saving Private Ryan.\nBorn into a Jewish family on December 18, 1946 in Cincinnati, Ohio, the young Spielberg showed an interest in filmmaking during his teen years. When he was 12 years old, Spielberg created a nine-minute film to earn his photography badge in the Boy Scouts. This was the first film he made. His parents divorced when he was 13, and Spielberg moved with his family to California. After graduating from high school, he applied to the University of Southern California (USC) to learn filmmaking, but did not graduate. Instead he attended Long Beach State, where he earned his degree in Film Production and Electronic Arts, 35 years after first attending college.\nHis early work was as a television writer, having written scripts for popular shows such as Night Gallery, Marcus Welby, M.D., and Columbo in the 70s. His breakthrough film in Hollywood was 1975's Jaws, which is one of the most popular, highest-grossing blockbuster in the history of the Silver Screen. He followed the success of Jaws with several films that have earned him a spot in Hollywood lore. His films have become household names.\nSpielberg shows no signs of slowing down. He is involved in several film projects as a director, and a producer. He has been married twice, and has six children. He was voted Forbes Magazine's Most Influential Celebrity in America in 2014.

The list of Jackson's peers in the industry is very short, to say the least. Jackson began his career in the early 1970s as the youngest member of the musical group The Jackson 5. Michael was the lead singer, and arguably the most talented of the five brothers who made up the band. He was born on August 29, 1958 as the eighth child of 10 in an African American family from Gary Indiana. The driving force behind the group's success was their father, Joseph \"Joe\" Jackson. The group was very popular in its time, but young Michael would go out on his own career soon after. He was a successful singer, songwriter, actor, dancer, and businessman, but his career was not without controversy.\nHis album Thriller is the best-selling album of all time. It was released in 1982, and was followed by a series of successful albums, films, music videos, and business ventures. In 1993 the first of several people came forward to accuse Jackson of sexually improper conduct on a child. This and other accusations would haunt Jackson throughout his adult life. Jackson also gained a reputation of strange behavior. One of the indelible images often associated with Jackson is when he held his newborn child over a hotel balcony to show it to his public.\nIt was rumored that Jackson bought the bones of the famous Elephant Man, slept in an oxygen tent, and that he altered his appearance to appear white. His photographs from his childhood and as a young adult show a very different Jackson. He married twice in his life including a brief marriage to Lisa Marie Presley, the daughter of the equally great musician, Elvis Presley.\nJackson died on June 25, 2009, and even his death was not without controversy. His family filed a wrongful death lawsuit against his doctor, who was subsequently found guilty.",

He is what is called an anthropomorphic character, which is a term used to describe a non-human character that has human characteristics. Mickey can speak, laugh, cry,  and use his hands like a human. He also walks on two legs rather than four. His trademark red shorts, large yellow shoes, white gloves, and over-sized mouse ears make him one of the most recognizable cartoon characters in America, and in the world.\nMickey was created by Disney in 1928 in the short film Steamboat Willie. That film was the first of 130 films starring the famous mouse. He has also starred  in 10 full-length, feature films. In the 1930s, Mickey began to appear in comic books, and on November 18, 1978 he got his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He became the first cartoon character to earn a star on the historic sidewalk. Ten of his films have been nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film  with Lend a Paw winning the award. Walt Disney received an Honorary Award for creating the character in 1932.\nOne of the most popular children's shows in American history was the \"Mickey Mouse Club,\" which ran from 1955 to 1996. Mickey has a girlfriend named Minnie Mouse, a dog named Pluto, and a host of friends that include Donald, and Daisy Duck, who are stars on their own.\nToday, Mickey Mouse merchandise can be found world wide. He appears in all Disney theme parks throughout the world. In 1988 Mickey made his last full-length film appearance when he starred in Who Framed Roger Rabbit. This was a significant occurrence because it was the first time that Disney characters starred alongside Warner Brother's characters. The two corporations had been long-time rivals.",

That was before the great Jackie Robinson broke what was called the color line in baseball. Prior to April 15, 1947, Major League Baseball was an exclusive \"whites only\" organization that barred black players from participation. Black Americans could only play in the Negro Leagues that existed roughly between 1920 through 1948. Robinson, and the Brooklyn Dodgers, put an end to segregation in baseball that year, and began a movement for racial equality in the United States.\nRobinson was born in Cairo, Georgia on January 31, 1919, but grew up in Pasadena, California, near Los Angeles. He was an outstanding athlete who played baseball and football for Pasadena City College, then at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA). During his time with the Dodgers, the team won one championship, and appeared in the World Series six times. From 1949 to 1954, Robinson was named to the All-Star Team, and he won the National League Most Valuable Player Award. He was also named the Baseball Rookie of the Year in 1947, the first year the award was given.\nToday, Robinson is honored by every team in both the National and American Leagues on Jackie Robinson Day. On that day, all MLB players wear the number 42 in honor of Robinson. That number, used to be worn by Robinson, was retired universally by all baseball teams, making it the first time any league has retired a number. No player on any MLB team can ever wear that number again. Robinson was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1962. He died on October 24, 1972, and was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Congressional Gold Medal for his part in changing American society.",

Founded by brothers Eddie and Alex Van Halen in their home in Pasadena, California in 1972, the band was one of the top rock acts in the country, and is as popular today as it was back then.\nEddie Van Halen is considered one of the best lead guitarists in the history of music by many of his peers, while Alex was a superior drummer. Together, they formed the nucleus of the popular band that also included bass guitarist, Michael Anthony, and vocalist, David Lee Roth. The brothers were born in the Netherlands, and immigrated to the United States when they were children. The two were inseparable, and developed an interest in music in the mid-60s.

In the mid to late 60s, America's involvement became a huge issue. The conflict in Vietnam was divisive for many reasons, but mostly because of the public's perception that it was an immoral and illegal operation. The other major factor was that the U.S. was still engaged in drafting young men into the service of the country against their will.\nOne of Hollywood's major film stars of the time was Jane Fonda. Fonda came from Hollywood movie royalty, being the daughter of the great actor, Henry Fonda. She won two Oscars, seven Golden Globe awards, and an Emmy award through her long career. In the 60s she was a political activist who was against the war in Vietnam. She was very outspoken against the conflict, as many celebrities were at the time.\nIn 1970, Fonda made headlines for a very different reason. She and two fellow actors starred in an anti-war film that drew much controversy. In July of 1972, Fonda drew the wrath of many Americans when she was photographed sitting with North Vietnamese Army members on an anti-aircraft gun. That image soiled her reputation as an actress, and as a true American. Many called Fonda a traitor for interacting with the enemy. Years later, Fonda said that she was manipulated into taking that photo, but many Americans still have their doubts.\nDuring her trip to North Vietnam, which was at war with the U.S. backed South Vietnam, Fonda made a number of radio broadcasts denouncing America's involvement in the war. This further cemented her image as a traitor. However, there are many Americans who feel she was a true patriot because she refused to stand still and spoke out against the war.",

With the growing popularity of American football and basketball, baseball now must share the limelight with these sports. During the late 1990s, baseball was in trouble. Attendance was down. High profile sports that featured fast-paced action such as football and basketball were stealing baseball's thunder. That was all before Barry Bonds and a couple of other sluggers brought the game back to center stage.\nBonds played the first part of his career with the Pittsburgh Pirates, where he enjoyed moderate success. After being traded to the San Francisco Giants in 1992, Bonds began a second career that put him into the spotlight for both the right and wrong reasons. At an age when most players begin to decline in performance because of their advancing age, Bonds went on a home run tear that was unprecedented in the history of the game.\nBonds never hit more than 34 home runs in one year for the Pirates, but, playing for the Giants, he hit an astounding 73 home runs in 2001. This shattered a record that had stood for 40 years. Bonds was 38 years old by the end of the 2001 season, and many questioned how he could put up numbers like that. The answer to that question came out years later when Bonds was accused of taking illegal, performance-enhancing drugs. Bonds eventually broke Henry Aaron's record for most home runs in a career, but many baseball purists feel that the record is tainted because of the illegal drug use.\nBonds' post baseball career has been damaged because of the drug use, and Major League Baseball has implemented a drug use policy since his retirement. He was indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of perjury for lying about his drug use, but was able to strike a deal to stay out of jail. In any event, his legacy is forever soiled.",

The ancient Greeks are said to have included a form of boxing as far back as 600 BC. The modern sport of boxing can be traced to the 16th Century when it became a popular sport in Great Britain. Today, the sport still uses a variation of the Marquess of Queensberry rules that were established in 1867. Boxing is the purest form of competition. It pits one man, or woman, against another in an enclosed ring with only the person's fists as weapons. Early matches in the United States featured bare-knuckle fighting, but today boxers use protective gloves.\nOne of the most successful boxers in America is Mike Tyson. Tyson holds several boxing records. The greatest is possibly when he became the youngest boxer ever to win the heavyweight championship in three different boxing organizations. Tyson was just over 20 years old when he accomplished this feat. He was one of the most feared fighters of his time. Tyson won a total of 50 fights with 44 of those victories coming by knockout.\nTwelve of Tyson's knockouts came in the first round, which earned him the nickname of Iron Mike. Eventually, his advancing age and fast living took their toll on Tyson. By the early 90s, his career was virtually over. Even though his boxing career lasted until 2002, Tyson was never the same. He went on to a brief acting career, most notably in the popular 2009 comedy hit The Hangover.\nTyson's post-boxing career had its ups and downs. He appeared on Barbara Walter's talk show with his wife, television actress Robin Givens, where Givens called Tyson a manic-depressive, and that living with him was pure torture. Tyson was arrested in 1991 for raping an 18-year-old girl, and spent several years in jail. He has attempted several comebacks, but has never regained his old glory.",

Obama is a representative of the Democratic Party with his presidency coming after the controversial George W.

This act was intended to increase the affordability of care for Americans, expand insurance coverage, and lower the uninsured rate in the country.

He is a graduate of both Columbia University in New York City, and Harvard Law School. Before becoming president, he served as senator for the state of Illinois. He is considered a liberal by many southern conservatives, but this may be an unfair label. The perception is largely due to the Affordable Care Act, and his attempts at immigration reform.

Lincoln served as president for only four short years, but his impact on the country at the time, and today, has been huge.\nDuring his presidency, the United States was in the middle of a terrible civil war. At the center of the split between the two sides was slavery. The north was a fast-growing, industrial region that was more progressive than their southern counterpart. The southern economy was based on cotton production that mostly used forced labor. The north viewed this practice as unethical, and immoral, while southerners claimed it was an integral part of their culture. When Lincoln won the election, the southern states began to secede from the Union, and the war began.\nLincoln vowed to end slavery during his campaign for president, while never speaking about how the country would keep its relationship with the southern states when slavery was ended. This angered many southerners who promised to rebel if Lincoln won. The war lasted four years, and about 620,000 soldiers died. In what is considered the turning point of the war, Lincoln issued his famous Emancipation Proclamation in January 1863. What it did was gain international favor from the world because of its ethical qualities. It put pressure on those countries doing business with the south to review their practices.

He did not see eye to eye with his employers, and chose to leave the hospital to pursue his own interests. In 1987, Kevorkian purchased advertising space in Detroit newspapers as a \"death consultant.\" His first known assisted suicide was for a 54-year-old woman who suffered from advanced Alzheimer's disease. Kevorkian was not charged in the case because Michigan did not have a law in place regarding assisted suicide. The state did file murder charges initially, but those charges were dropped. The Michigan Medical Board, however, did strip Kevorkian of his medical practitioner's license.\nKevorkian defended himself at subsequent trials by claiming he took no action to assist in his patient's suicide. He had invented a machine that was designed to be operated by the patient using the machine. Therefore, Kevorkian argued he had no hand in causing the death of his patients. His patients had complete control of the suicide from start to finish. Kevorkian's role in the deaths was to simply help attach his patients to his machine. The rest was up to them.

She was an accomplished aviator, the first woman to fly across the Atlantic Ocean solo. She accomplished this during a time when women were not highly regarded in the United States. American women during the 1930s did not have the same advantages men had. There were few employment opportunities. Educated women were a scarcity. Women who did find employment during this era were working as grade-school teachers, nannies, and maids for the most part. Amelia Earhart did a lot to change that perception.\nAlthough Earhart was born into a family that did see financial success, but that success was fleeting. There were times in her life when her family struggled to make ends meet because of poor money management. Earhart was home schooled for most of her life, and she gained her pilots license at an early age. In December of 1920, Earhart's father took Amelia to an airshow in Long Beach, California. This is where she first became interested in flying. After earning her aviator's license, she accomplished a feat that only a few men had ever done: flying solo across the Atlantic. She earned national fame for this and was soon a household name.\nTragically, Earhart was lost in an attempt to fly around the world in 1937. She was never found. The theories about how she met her end are countless. Many think she fell victim to the Japanese prior to the start of World War II. This thinking was rooted in the idea that Earhart was a spy. Other outlandish theories include alien kidnapping, but most likely she had mechanical difficulties flying over the Pacific Ocean. Earhart was either killed instantly, or survived, according to one popular theory, and lived out her days on a deserted island.",

That was the year Lindbergh flew from New York City to Paris across the Atlantic Ocean solo. Aviation technology was not very advanced during that time period. Lindbergh's plane The Spirit of St. Louis was believed by many to be simply too small to make the solo flight across the great Atlantic. Just carrying enough fuel for the flight was a challenge, and so was the trip itself. Because of the limitations on the speed of aircraft at the time, it would take many hours to make the trip; it was generally accepted that a pilot could not make it alone. Lindbergh would not be deterred though.\nLindbergh was working as a mail pilot when he decided to make his cross-Atlantic flight. Six well-known and trained aviators had lost their lives trying to make the flight before him, so his odds for success were not in his favor. On the morning of May 20, 1927, Lindbergh launched his small plane from Roosevelt Field in New York, and determined to reach Paris. The flight was an international event as Lindbergh's progress was reported by report stations throughout his flight. Lindbergh faced many dangers and challenges during his flight, including foul weather, and flying blind through thick fog. He also had to fight his fatigue during the nearly 54-hour flight.\nIt was all well worth the trouble when Lindbergh landed in Paris on Saturday night, May 21, 1927. More than 150,000 French citizens had gathered to join the celebration of his historic flight. Lindbergh had become an international superstar literally overnight. He came home to an adoring American public that celebrated his fame with a parade through the streets of New York City.",

Anthony was fighting for women's rights long before the social revolution 50 years ago. She was born in 1820 to a Quaker family. Quakers are a close-knit, faith-based group of people who live a very simple and strict life. It is a traditional way of life where gender roles are clearly defined.\nShe spent much of her early life fighting for social change. She was an anti-slavery abolitionist, teacher, author, and was a leading figure in gaining women the right to vote, and to hold office. The suffrage movement was designed to gain voting rights for women who previously had no voice in government. Another social cause Anthony was heavily involved with was the anti-slavery movement. Anthony made her family farm available for like-minded people to have anti-slavery meetings. She was involved in the abolitionist movement until the end of the American Civil War, when slavery was abolished. She then turned her attention to women's rights.\nAnthony founded a weekly publication called \"The Revolution\", which she used to publish women's rights literature. The newspaper's motto was \"Men their rights, and nothing more; women their rights, and nothing less.\"\nIn 1872, after touring the country trying to build momentum for women's rights, she illegally voted in the presidential election. She was arrested and fined, even though she fought. Anthony never paid the fine. The incident served to bring more awareness to the struggle women had to endure. Anthony fought the good fight until her death in 1905 at the age of 84. She is honored today by the United States mint with the Susan B. Anthony $1 coin.",

Prior to the 1770s, the region was largely Indian country with the exception of 13 British colonies in the northeast part of the country. These colonies were known as the American Colonies, and were under British rule. The 13 colonies were a loosely connected group of individual states that were governed by the Continental Congress. The congress had been at odds against the British for several years, primarily because of the taxes that were being levied by their Parliament.\nIn 1775, after a year of war between the American colonies and England, the colonists decided it was time to become independent. The English Parliament had issued two unpopular taxes, which were imposed to help support the British after the end of the Seven Years War. The colonists asked Thomas Jefferson to write the Declaration of Independence arguing that since the colonies had no voice in Parliament's matters, they should not be taxed.\nThe declaration was drafted by Jefferson on July 2, 1776, and was approved by the Continental Congress on July 4th. Today, July 4th is celebrated in the United States as the day of independence from British rule. The declaration features what has been called the most famous sentence in the English language. It reads: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.\" These words were written to represent the moral and ethical standards the new country was meant to follow.

On November 24, Cooper hijacked a Boeing 727 jetliner after purchasing a one-way ticket from Portland to Seattle, Washington. Cooper demanded $200,000, and four parachutes  upon arrival to Seattle. Authorities complied with his ransom request, and Cooper let all 36 passengers, and most of the crew off the plane at that time.\nOnce back in the air, Cooper directed the pilot to fly to Mexico, but the jet's fuel was not enough to make there without stopping to refuel. It was decided to land in Reno, Nevada for refueling. When the aircraft reached Reno, Cooper was not on board. It is thought that Cooper jumped out of the aircraft somewhere in the wooded forests of Oregon.

He has been in the American spotlight for decades ever since he was a star football player at the University of Southern California, a premier academic university which is primarily known for its full, rich football tradition.\nUSC is one of the greatest places for future pro football players to get their start. Simpson knew this when he transferred to the school in the mid-1960s from San Francisco Community College. At USC, Simpson found fame. His fortune was to come later. He helped the university reach the coveted Rose Bowl berth in 1968, following an outstanding 1967 season where he led the nation in rushing yards. His 64-yard run against arch-rival UCLA, in what many people say was the greatest game in college football history, is what legends are made of. Simpson later played in the National Football League, where he gained more fame and fortune. Upon retirement, he turned to an acting career where he starred in many commercials, and eventually movies.\nUnfortunately, Simpson's life took a tragic turn years later. He was accused of murdering his wife, and her friend in the early 90s. His trial was one of the most watched events in the history of television. Simpson was acquitted of the murder, due largely to his \"Dream Team\" of the high-priced attorneys. Many people believed that Simpson committed the murder and got away with it.\nSimpson was later convicted in a Nevada court for several offenses, and is currently serving time in prison. Many believe this conviction was retribution for his earlier crimes.",

At one time, women were not allowed to vote, own property, or get education. Since those dark times, the women of America have made great strides in their struggle for equality. One of their heroes was the great Billie Jean King.\nKing was a professional tennis player, who gained great success during her career on the women's tennis court. She won 39 Grand Slam Titles, 12 singles, 16 women's doubles, and 11 mixed doubles. She found success in just about every venue she participated in, including the Federation Cup Championships. King's greatest accomplishment, however, was an exhibition match that took place in Houston, Texas on September 20, 1973.\nThe 29-year-old King, who was at the top of her professional career at the time, faced a former Wimbledon Champion, Bobby Riggs. Riggs was one of the best men's players during his prime in the late 1930s and 40s. The 55-year-old Riggs challenged King to an exhibition match claiming that the women's game was far inferior to the men's game. He said that even a 55-year-old, \"washed-up\" former player could beat the top woman in the world. The stage was set for the match. However, it was not much of a match at all.\nKing soundly defeated Riggs without much trouble. The match was later exposed for what many people claimed it would be: a showcase for King to demonstrate that women could compete against men. The victory was part of the equal rights movement that was sweeping the nation during that time. King became an outspoken advocate of equal rights for women.",

Her sexy, and scantily clad costumes and performances both delighted and aggravated the American public for years. She excelled at pushing the boundaries of what most Americans perceived as acceptable in her music videos and live performances. Madonna did not shy away from controversial subjects, either.\nMadonna was born in Bay City, Michigan in 1958. She moved to New York City to pursue a career in dancing as a young woman. She began her music career with a couple of club bands in New York, but was soon noticed by music industry executives. In 1983, she released her first album titled simply, \"Madonna.\" This was just the beginning for the superstar. She followed her initial success with several hit albums and singles such as Like a Virgin, and Into the Groove. She coupled her commercial success in music with successful performances in a series of movies such as Desperately Seeking Susan, and Evita. It seemed there was nothing Madonna could not do.\nOne of Madonna's defining characteristics is her ability to reinvent herself. Many artists find success in the very competitive, entertainment industry, but most are only successful for a short period of time, but not Madonna. She has sold more than 300 million records worldwide to date. She ranked second only to the Beatles on Billboard's list of Greatest Acts of the 20th Century.\nMadonna's career has not been without controversy, though. She has been the subject of several lawsuits for her acts, but she survived, and thrived through it all. She is still one of the best female artists in the United States today.",

Eastwood's words became an instant catchphrase that many Americans can recite to this day. Eastwood is quite possibly the epitome of the macho American man. He holds icon-like status among males for portraying the tough guy in nearly all his films.\nEastwood was born in 1930 in San Francisco before coming to Los Angeles at an early age. He briefly attended Los Angeles City College, but soon dropped out to pursue an acting career. After appearing in a couple of low-budget films, Eastwood got his big break in the old TV western Rawhide. His character Rowdy Yates was an instant celebrity, and it launched Eastwood's incredible career. Eastwood first burst onto the big screen with his roles in three western movies in the 1960s. The so-called Spaghetti Westerns, which were called that because of their ties to Italian cinema, were all very successful, and made Eastwood a household name.\nEastwood followed his success with a string of movies that is unparalleled in Hollywood history. He starred in the very popular Dirty Harry franchise, where he, once again, played the tough guy. In this series, Dirty Harry is a San Francisco police officer who takes matters into his own hands. This troubles his superiors to no end, but Harry always wins. This persona delighted the American movie audiences,  especially the men.\nActing was not the only talent Eastwood would eventually display. He became an Oscar-winning director also. Arguably, his best film as a director was Million Dollar Baby, but it is hard to pick one film from his impressive list of movies. He is still active in film at the age of 74.",

Many members of American society felt disenfranchised and discriminated against, especially in the workplace. Some American workers enjoyed a living wage complete with benefits and other advantages, while others struggled to earn enough to survive. One of the most oppressed groups of workers during this time period was California farm workers.\nThe farm workers were migrant workers who came into the country mostly without documentation to work in the fertile fields of California's Great Central Valley. This region in central California has often been described as the country's fruit basket because of its rich soil and high yields. Farm workers tended these fields during the day, and lived and slept on the farm at night. They earned less than the state's minimum wage, and had no fringe benefits other American workers enjoyed. Cesar Chavez changed all that.\nCesar Chavez, the Arizona-born civil-rights activist and labor leader, became the voice of these workers, and began a movement to bring basic rights to this group. Taking the lead from the great Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Chavez began a series of non-violent demonstrations protesting the deplorable conditions farm workers had to endure. Many of these workers worked much longer than eight hours a day, and received no overtime pay. Chavez, who was a farm worker himself in the 50s, led marches, and called for boycotts. These activities were very effective in changing the working conditions for farm workers and other oppressed workers.\nChavez was highly recognized during his lifetime, and his legacy increased after his death in 1993.

He was honored with every award available during his years in the army during World War II. He also won awards for heroism from two foreign governments, Belgium and France. His military record is impressive, as he fought successfully in some of the most dangerous, and historic battles during the great war. Murphy also found success after the war as an actor who appeared in several films.\nMurphy was born into a very large family in Hunt, Texas. He was one of 12 children, and grew up in abject poverty. His father deserted his family; his mother died at a young age, so Murphy dropped out of school to get work. Murphy held a series of odd jobs from an early age to help the family financially, but eventually realized that a military life was the best course to take.\nAfter the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Murphy knew he needed to be in the military to defend his country, but he was not yet old enough to enlist legally. With the help of one of his older sisters, who helped provide him with false records, Murphy enlisted into the Army at the age of 17. It wasn't long before Murphy began making his name in the military. He first saw action in the invasion of Sicily, and was involved in the liberation of Rome. He became famous for leading his men into a battle while he was wounded, and out of ammunition. He won several awards for valor.\nAfter the war, he launched a successful Hollywood career. His most notable film was playing himself in the epic movie classic From Here to Eternity, which was based on his autobiography. Murphy starred in several western-themed films. He died at the age of 46 in a plane crash in the state of Virginia.",

        "content": "During the early part of the 20th Century, polio was considered one of the greatest health threats in the United States of America. Polio was a vicious disease that took its victim's lives, or left them with major disabilities. In 1952, the U.S. suffered one of its harshest epidemics of polio in its history. More than 58,000 cases of polio were reported that year, and 3,145 people lost their lives. Additionally, more than 21,000 people suffered some form of paralysis that ranged from mild paralysis to extreme cases where people became disabled. Dr. Jonas Salk is responsible for ending that plague.\nBorn in New York City on October 28, 1914, Jonas Salk grew up in modest surroundings. His parents were not wealthy, but they were able to put food on the table, and maintain a roof over their children's head. Salk demonstrated great academic success from childhood. By the age of 13, he was enrolled into a school for gifted children. He was considered a perfectionist by his peers, and succeeded academically in a very competitive environment. In college, Salk opted to go into medical school even though his mother wanted him to become an attorney. After graduating from medical school, Salk began his research on polio, which was considered  a scourge of western society.\nPolio had baffled medical science since its discovery in the mid-19th Century. When Salk turned his attention to the disease, there was little hope that anyone could find an adequate cure. Salk developed his vaccine in the early 1950s, and in April of 1955, his accomplishment was heralded in newspapers across the country. Salk became a national hero. His vaccine effectively ended the polio epidemic in the United States and many countries around the world.",

        "content": "One of the greatest barriers in existence during the infancy of air travel was the speed of sound. It was considered impossible to build and fly an airplane that could exceed this speed, but that was before the world was introduced to Chuck Yeager. Yeager was already  an accomplished fighter pilot in World War II, but his greatest achievement was after the war when he served as a test pilot for the United States Air Force. It was thought impossible to fly faster than sound during that period, and no one knew if a pilot could survive flying at that speed, or how it would affect him if he did survive. That did not deter Yeager, though.\nYeager was born on February 13, 1923 in Myra, West Virginia. He served during World War II as a fighter pilot. He did not start out as a pilot, though. Yeager enlisted as a private who worked as an aircraft mechanic in the old Army Air Forces, where Yeager enrolled into a special program that trained enlisted men to become pilots. Yeager benefited greatly from having superior eyesight. He was considered a natural pilot early in his flight career.\nAs a fighter pilot in the European Theater, Yeager was shot down in France by German fighter planes. He avoided capture, and helped a fellow pilot to safety after that pilot had lost his leg in the crash. Yeager was awarded a medal for his actions. He demonstrated exceptional talent as a pilot and once shot down five enemy fighters in a single day. After the war, Yeager began a new career as a test pilot, where he flew the experimental aircraft Bell X-1 into aviation history.\nOn October 14, 1947, Yeager flew his X-1 faster than the speed of sound. He became the first human being to fly faster than sound, and he went on to break more records during his 60-year flight history. Yeager retired from the army with the rank of Brigadier General, and has won many honors for his contributions to aviation.",

Instead of reacting with dispatch, Bush continued his activity seemingly unaffected by the terror unfolding in New York. He was criticized heavily for his apparent blase attitude. This was the first of several controversial moves Bush made while serving as president.\nBush was born on July 6, 1946 to a politically powerful family. His father George H.W. Bush served as the 41st U.S. president. George W. Bush also served as governor of the state of Texas from 1995 to 2000.\nHis father once said that the younger Bush \"faced the greatest challenge of any president since Abraham Lincoln.\" In reaction to 9/11, Bush deployed U.S. troops to Afghanistan to combat terrorism, and attacked Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq because of inaccurate intelligence that claimed the Muslim leader was developing weapons of mass destruction. Both decisions hurt his presidency greatly.\nBush's victories in both the 2000 and 2004 elections were also not without controversy, as both elections were contested. Many observers claimed improper tactics were used to gain the White House in both instances.",

        "content": "Rush Hudson Limbaugh is a conservative radio talk show host who has the most listened-to show in the United States. The audience for his national show is thought to exceed 15 million listeners per show. He is ultra-conservative, and is not shy about voicing his opinions on the air. This may be why he is so popular. Love him, or hate him, Limbaugh does not pull punches with his commentary. His favorite subjects to attack are liberals, and what he perceives as liberal bias in mainstream media.\nLimbaugh was born on January 12, 1951 in Cape Girardeau, Missouri to a family of professionals. His grandfather, father, and brother were all attorneys, and his uncle served as a federal judge in his home state of Missouri. Limbaugh began broadcasting at an early age. He was an average student, and attended college for less than one full year. His mother had aspired for Rush to get a college degree, but that was not to be. She once said of her son, \"He flunked everything,\" and \"he didn't seem interested in anything but radio.\"\nLimbaugh made the right decision. Today, he is one of the highest paid journalists in the field. His road to fortune was not an easy one, though. He used to bounce from job to job mainly at small radio stations as a music disc jockey. His first major break came in 1984 when he was a radio talk show host in Sacramento, California. It was here that President Ronald Reagan was successful in his repeal of the Fairness Doctrine. This doctrine required media outlets to give air-time to opposing viewpoints whenever the station made a controversial claim.\nWith this doctrine out of the way, Limbaugh was free to say whatever he wanted to, and not have to give equal time to anyone. He took full advantage of this ruling. His audience consists of a large segment of American society, especially the right-wing, conservative, Christian coalition.",

She will always be remembered as America's first, bona-fide sex symbol having starred in numerous Hollywood movies and posing nude for national men's magazines. She may not have been the first actress or entertainer to use her sex to make a name for herself, but she was the first to do it in the modern media age, where she was visible to most of the country.\nBorn on June 1, 1926 in Los Angeles, California, Monroe had natural beauty and talent from the beginning although her childhood was marked by tragedy. She was born to an unwed mother who was unable to care for her child because of her mental and financial instability. Monroe was placed in foster homes, where she lived with different families throughout most of her childhood. She never knew who her biological father was. She even thought for a time that her father was the famous Hollywood actor Clark Gable. Monroe was reunited with her mother as a teenager, but was soon taken away from her because of mental issues. She spent the rest of her youth living with her mother's best friend, Grace.\nIt was during her time with Grace that Monroe developed her love for the cinema. The two would often go to see movies together, and Monroe became fascinated by the Hollywood lifestyle. She began her career in small parts in \"B\" movies, but was soon noticed by Hollywood producers. Her first starring role came in 1952's Don't Bother to Knock. Her acting career took off after that.\nMonroe parlayed her popularity into a relationship with President John F. Kennedy after performing at one of his birthday parties.

Sinatra had one of the smoothest, most recognizable voices of any singer before, or since him. He was suave, and debonair, and he epitomized the \"cool cate\" persona popular in that era. Sinatra may have gotten his start in entertainment with his golden voice, but he was able to transition that talent into a successful film career. He also lists directing, producing, and conducting among his list of considerable talent.\nSinatra was born on December 12, 1915 in Hoboken, New Jersey. He was the son of Italian, Catholic immigrants who came to the United States in search of a better life for their children. Sinatra showed interest in music from an early age. He was greatly influenced by big band music, and got his first job singing at local bars at the age of 8. Sinatra was a rowdy young boy.\nAs a teenager in the 1930s, Sinatra had worked several odd jobs before he got a break performing with the Tommy Dorsey Band. This band was a major attraction, and it marked the beginning of Sinatra's entertainment career. Sinatra parted ways with Dorsey, and by 1941, he was a legitimate star on his own. His popularity grew during the next decade, but went into decline by the 1950s. It was then that Sinatra first appeared on the Silver Screen. He starred opposite Gene Kelly in the film adaptation of Anchors Aweigh. This film not only began a second career for Sinatra, it also revitalized his singing career.\nSinatra's legacy is firmly in place. He sang some of the most memorable love songs in the history of U.S. music, and his music is as popular today as it was during his era.",

        "content": "One of the most famous child stars in the history of films in the United States was the great Shirley Temple. Temple starred in some of the greatest movies ever made during the film industry's infancy. Born on April 23, 1928 in Santa Monica, California, Temple was encouraged by her mother to develop her interest in singing, acting, and dancing. She enrolled young Shirley into a dance school at the age of 3. She also began styling Shirley's hair copying silent movie star Mary Pickford's wholesome, All-American, pigtail look.\nHer first acting experience came while she was still in the dancing school at a very young age. She appeared in a series of short films where child actors were used to play adults. The shorts, as they were called, were satirical in nature, and soon fell out of favor with the public. Temple gained valuable acting experience at a young age, though. A Fox Film songwriter was very taken by the young star, and he introduced her to studio executives. She was signed to do her first film in 1933 at the age of 5. The film Stand Up and Cheer was a big hit, and Temple's career was off.\nHer career is one of the most remarkable in Hollywood history. She made dozens of successful films as a child actress. She was very mature, and talented for someone so young, but by 1942, her films began to flop. Her career was seemingly over by her teen years, and announced her official retirement in 1950. This did not stop Temple though, as she began a second career as a public servant. She got involved with the Republican party, ran in a special election, in California, in 1967, but lost. She was then noticed by U.S. Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, who offered her a diplomatic position, which she accepted. She served as ambassador to several countries during her political career under President Gerald Ford, and President George H.W. Bush.",

Ford got his start in film in the George Lucas film American Graffiti. The story behind Ford's involvement in the film is what Hollywood lore is made of. Ford was working as a carpenter on a job at Lucas' house when the Star Wars director discovered him. Lucas was so impressed by Ford that he gave him a supporting role in the movie. Ford has starred in many of Lucas' hits, most notably the original Star Wars trilogy.\nFord was born on July 13, 1942 in Chicago, Illinois. He was an average student in high school, but he did have one passion: radio broadcasting. He served as voice of his high school football team his senior year at Maine East High School. It was there that Ford took a drama class so that he could get over his shyness. After graduating from college, Ford moved to Los Angeles in hopes of getting work as a radio voice over actor. He did not get the job, but he did sign a studio contract to appear in bit parts for $150 per week.\nHis film career is impressive, but he has not garnered the individual awards he has sought, specifically an Oscar. He was nominated for Best Actor for his role in Witness, but did not win, however. He has won many film industry awards throughout his career. He was honored by the academy with his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in Los Angeles.\nFord is a life-long Democrat who has become politically involved in recent years.
